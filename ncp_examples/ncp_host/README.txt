* \section intro Introduction
*
* NXP NCP host sample application provides reference code of communication between NCP host and NCP device over NCP TLV protocol.
* NCP host could connect to redfinch NCP device through multiple HW interfaces. Developers can refer to NCP APIs for Wi-Fi, 
* Bluetooth LE and 15.4 to implement their own sample application which runs on their host platform. \n
* Note: 
* Default NCP host MCU platform: RT1060 EVKB.
* NCP device supported two kinds redfinch boards:
* RD-RW612-BGA: UART/SPI/USB/SDIO,
* FRDM-RW612: UART/SPI/USB.
