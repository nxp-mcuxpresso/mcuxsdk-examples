* \section intro Introduction
*
* NXP NCP host sample applicaiton provides reference code of communication between
* NCP host and NCP device over NCP TLV protocol.
* NCP host could connect to Redfinch NCP device through multiple HW interfaces.
* Developers can refer to NCP APIs for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE and 15.4 to implement their own sample
* application which runs on their host platform.
* Note:
* Default NCP host MCU plafrom: RT1060 EVKB
* NCP device supported two kinds redfinch boards:
* RD-RW612-BGA: UART/SPI/USB/SDIO,
* FRDM-RW612: UART/SPI/USB.
