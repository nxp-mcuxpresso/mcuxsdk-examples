      brief: 'The Multicore Manager example application demonstrates advanced features
        of the MCMGR component. In this demo, the primary core prints the "Hello World
        from the Primary Core!" string to the terminal and then releases the secondary
        core from the reset. The secondary core toggles an on-board LED indicating
        that the secondary core is running.

        It is also possible to stop/start the secondary core during the runtime by
        pressing on-board buttons. The on-board LED then indicates the change, it
        stops/starts toggling accordingly.

        This application also shows how to use the Multicore Manager for remote core
        monitoring and handling of events such as application, CoreUp, CoreDown and
        exception events.

        Application-specific callback functions for events are registered by the MCMGR_RegisterEvent()
        API on the primary core. Triggering these events is done using the MCMGR_TriggerEvent()
        API on the secondary core. While CoreUp, CoreDown events are triggered from
        startup and MCMGR code, the application event is triggered from the application.

        The exception event is triggered in the secondary application after 100 LED
        toggles by trying to write to flash. This raises the exception on the secondary
        core and triggers the RemoteExceptionEvent on the primary core.'
