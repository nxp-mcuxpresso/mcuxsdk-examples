      brief: 'The Multicore RPMsg-Lite pingpong RTOS project is a simple demonstration
        program that uses the MCUXpresso SDK software, the RPMsg-Lite library and
        Linux rpmsg driver and shows how to implement the inter-core communication
        between cores of the multicore system. The Master core run on Linux OS(MPU),
        and the remote core run on MCU(MCU). After soc reset and Linux boot up, the
        inter-core communication is established. Once the RPMsg is initialized and
        endpoints are created the message exchange starts, incrementing a virtual
        counter that is part of the message payload. The message pingpong finishes
        when the counter reaches the value of 100. Then the RPMsg-Lite is deinitialized
        and the procedure of the data exchange is repeated again.

        Shared memory usage

        This multicore example uses the shared memory for data exchange. The shared
        memory region is defined and the size can be adjustable by RL_BUFFER_COUNT
        and RL_BUFFER_PAYLOAD_SIZE in rpmsg_config.h. The shared memory region start
        address have to be defined in board.h or app.h. The size and start address
        must match with the config of DeviceTree of Linux.'
