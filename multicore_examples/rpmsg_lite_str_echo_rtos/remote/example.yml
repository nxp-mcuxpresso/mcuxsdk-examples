      brief: "The Multicore RPMsg-Lite string echo project is a simple demonstration\
        \ program that uses the MCUXpresso SDK software and the RPMsg-Lite library\
        \ and shows how to implement the inter-core communication between cores of\
        \ the multicore system.\nIt works with Linux RPMsg master peer to transfer\
        \ string content back and forth. The name service handshake is performed first\
        \ to create the communication channels. Next, Linux OS waits for user input\
        \ to the RPMsg virtual tty. Anything which is received is sent to Cortex-M.\
        \ Cortex-M displays what is received, and echoes back the same message as\
        \ an acknowledgement. The tty reader on the Linux side can get the message,\
        \ and start another transaction. The demo demonstrates RPMsg\u2019s ability\
        \ to send arbitrary content back and forth. Note - The maximum message length\
        \ supported by RPMsg is 496 bytes. String longer than 496 will be divided\
        \ by virtual tty into several messages.\nShared memory usage\nThis multicore\
        \ example uses the shared memory for data exchange. The shared memory region\
        \ is defined and the size can be adjustable in the linker file. The shared\
        \ memory region start address and the size have to be defined in linker file\
        \ for each core equally. The shared memory start address is then exported\
        \ from the linker to the application."
