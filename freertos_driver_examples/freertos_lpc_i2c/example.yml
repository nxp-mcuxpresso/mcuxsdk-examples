      brief: 'The freertos_i2c example shows an application using RTOS tasks with
        I2C driver:The example supports 2 different connections:On board connection
        and board to board connection.With one board connection, 2 I2C instances of
        the same board are used. One i2c instance used as I2C master and another I2C
        instance used as I2C slave .    Default settings in freertos_i2c.c is applied.
        Two tasks are created. One task is associated with an I2C master operation
        and another task deals with I2C slave operation.    1. I2C master task sends
        data to I2C slave task.    2. I2C master task reads data sent back from I2C
        slave task.    The transmit data and the receive data of both I2C master task
        and I2C slave task are printed out on terminal.With board to board connection,
        one I2C instance on one board is used as I2C master and the I2C instance on
        other board is used as I2C slave. Tasks are created to run on each board to
        handle I2C communication.    File freertos_i2c.c should have following definitions:    #define
        EXAMPLE_CONNECT_I2C BOARD_TO_BOARD    For board used as I2C master:        #define
        I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isMASTER    For board used as I2C slave:        #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE
        isSLAVE'
