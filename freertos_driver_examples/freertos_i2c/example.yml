      brief: 'The freertos_i2c example shows an application using RTOS tasks with
        I2C driver:The example supports 2 different connections:On board connection
        and board to board connection.With one board connection, 2 I2C instances of
        the same board are used. One i2c instance used as I2C master and another I2C
        instance used as I2C slave .    Default settings in freertos_i2c.c (in folder
        boards/<board>/rtos_examples/freertos_i2c) is applied.    Two tasks are created.
        One task is associated with an I2C master operation and another task deals
        with I2C slave operation.    1. I2C master task sends data to I2C slave task.    2.
        I2C master task reads data sent back from I2C slave task.    The transmit
        data and the receive data of both I2C master task and I2C slave task are printed
        out on terminal.With board to board connection, one I2C instance on one board
        is used as I2C master and the I2C instance on other board is used as I2C slave.
        Tasks are created to run on each board to handle I2C communication.    File
        freertos_i2c.c should have following definitions:    #define EXAMPLE_CONNECT_I2C
        BOARD_TO_BOARD    For board used as I2C master:        #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE
        isMASTER    For board used as I2C slave:        #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isSLAVE'
