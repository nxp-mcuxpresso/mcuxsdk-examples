      brief: 'The freertos_ecspi example shows how to use ECSPI driver in FreeRTOS:In
        this example , one ecspi instance is used as ECSPI master with blocking and
        another ecspi instance is used as ECSPI slave.1. ECSPI master sends/receives
        data using task blocking calls to/from ECSPI slave. (ECSPI Slave uses interrupt
        to receive/sendthe data)The example supports board to board connection.With
        board to board connection, one ECSPI instance on one board is used as ECSPI
        master and the ECSPI instance on other board is used as ECSPI slave. Tasks
        are created to run on each board to handle ECSPI communication.    File freertos_ecspi.c
        should have following definitions:    #define EXAMPLE_CONNECT_ECSPI BOARD_TO_BOARD    For
        board used as ECSPI master:        #define ECSPI_MASTER_SLAVE isMASTER    For
        board used as ECSPI slave:        #define ECSPI_MASTER_SLAVE isSLAVE'
