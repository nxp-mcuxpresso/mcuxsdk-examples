      brief: The IEE APC demo application demonstrates usage of the IEE and IEE APC
        driver. The Inline Encryption Engine (IEE) together with IEE APC provides
        a means to perform inline encryption and decryption of information transferred
        over memory interfaces. This demo application configures region 0 to perform
        AES XTS encryption and decryption while region 1 to perform AES-CTR decryption
        from external QSPI FLASH memory. Then data are written into RAM memory (region
        0), after that encryption is disabled and encrypted data read. After the successful
        read, encryption is enabled and memory read again to see that data matches
        the original written value. Another encrypted data are programmed into FLASH
        memory (region 1) and after encryption is enabled data are read and compared
        with expected data.
