      brief: This demo is used to show all the power modes. With this demo, user can
        navigate all the power modes that are existing in primary core. In typical
        use case, the primary core is running the main control logic, while the slave
        core is used to run the protocol or other complex mid-ware independently.
        Then the slave core prepares the resource (data, message, etc) into the somewhere,
        so that the master core would fetch when necessary. In some other cases, master
        core would send the some kinds of message to the slave core, and ask the slave
        core to enter indicated power mode. This demo download the image to both cores,
        also provides the reference code to enter any power mode.
