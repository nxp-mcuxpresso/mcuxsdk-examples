      brief: This  example  demonstrates  use  of  the  FFT  metering  library  in  the  typical  three-phase  power  meter
        application with  proportional  current  sensor  and  with  the  S/W  phase  shift  correction.  AFE  conversion
        mode (single/continuous) may be selected by the 'AFE_MODE' constant. Number
        of the FFT samples is set to 64, number of output harmonics is 32 then. This
        example allows to measure the sense of rotation of the 3-ph mains.
