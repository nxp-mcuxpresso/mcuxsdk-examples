# xrdc_hard_fault_handler

## Overview
The XRDC hard fault demo application demonstrates how the resources (memory regions
and peripherals) can be protected by XRDC peripheral. XRDC is configured by the 
RDMGR component, which uses configuration file (config block) generated by PAM tool.
In this example is used configuration where CPU0 has no access to memory region
from address deffined by macro MEM_REG_START and WDOG0 peripheral. Access to this
resources causes hard fault event, this example also shows how can be handled and
read information about violent access from XRDC peripheral.
The first memory region (kXRDC_MemMrc0_0) is configured with option "lock", it means
the XRDC registers for this memory region will be set only once, changes will not be
possible until the next reset. The application try change the configuration of locked
memory region, but the configuration remains unchanged.
