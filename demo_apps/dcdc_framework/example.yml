      brief: This demo is used to show a kind of usage of DCDC function. In this case,
        the DCDC is used as the voltage regulator instead of on-chip LDOs. For the
        condition that DCDC input voltage is not so stable, as the battery's voltage
        decrease after a few working time, a timer is used to trigger the adjustment
        by sampling the ADC value of bandgap/battery input voltage, calculating them
        and setting the result into the DCDC module, so that the output of DCDC would
        be adjusted and kepted constant as much as possible. Actually, this use case
        is usually used in the connectivity application, and the period of adjust
        (configured by the timer's timeout period) is also setup according to requirement.
