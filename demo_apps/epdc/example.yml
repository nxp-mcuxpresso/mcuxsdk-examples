      brief: This example shows how to use the PXP to process pixels, apply waveform
        mode then use the EPDC to drive the E-INK panel. In this example, first an
        image of RGB888 pixel format is processed by PXP to generate Y4 pixel data.
        Then PXP waveform engine will apply the waveform mode 2 to the pixel data
        for EPDC to update high quality image to the screen. The same image is updated
        to screen 4 times on different locations. Collision shall occur and non-collided
        update(s) will appear on screen together within one fresh, the collided update(s)
        will wait until the previous update(s) finish then refresh. Next the panel
        is cleared and PXP waveform engine will constantly apply the waveform mode
        1 to black dot for EPDC to draw line on panel to simulate pen input. The update
        shall be non-flashy and quicker than image update.
