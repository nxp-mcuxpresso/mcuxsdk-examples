      brief: 'The Power mode switch demo application demonstrates the use of power
        modes in the KSDK. The demo prints the power mode menuthrough the debug console,
        where the user can set the MCU to a specific power mode. The user can also
        set the wakeupsource by following the debug console prompts. The purpose of
        this demo is to show how to switch between different power modes, and how
        to configure a wakeup source and wakeup the MCU from low power modes. Tips:
        This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other.
        However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption
        even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary
        module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks
        before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low
        power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of
        a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most
        time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable
        the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper
        pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application
        hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste
        some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application
        hardware. - Debug pins(e.g SWD_DIO) would consume addtional power, had better
        to disable related pins or disconnect them. '
