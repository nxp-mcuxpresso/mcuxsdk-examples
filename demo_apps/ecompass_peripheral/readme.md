# ecompass_peripheral

## Overview

The code of this demo has been prepared and updated for use with the MCUXpresso Configuration Tools (Pins/Clocks/Peripherals).
The E-Compass demo application demonstrates the use of the FXOS8700 sensor. The tilt-compensated algorithm calculates
all three angles (pitch, roll, and yaw or compass heading). You can open the mex file with MCUXpresso Config Tool to do further
configuration of pin, clock and peripheral.
