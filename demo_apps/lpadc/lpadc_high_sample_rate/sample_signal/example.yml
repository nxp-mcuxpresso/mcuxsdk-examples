      brief: This demo application demonstrates the use of the LPADC to sample the
        analog signal. In this demo, the ADC clock is set as the maximum frequency,
        users should input analog signals to the ADC channel, press any keys to trigger
        the ADC conversion. After sampling enough sample points, the ADC will be disabled
        and the sample data will be print via UART. Users can use some tools such
        as EXCEL to recover the input signal based on those printed data.
