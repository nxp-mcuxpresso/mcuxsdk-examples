      brief: The lpadc sample rate count demo application can be used to measure ADC's
        sample rate roughly. The sample rate for an ADC is defined as the number of
        output samples available per unit time, and is specified as samples per second(SPS).
        The sample rate is the reciprocal of one sample total conversion time. Total
        conversion time = sampling time + compare time In this demo, users can select
        sample time, and the compare time is fixed to 17.5 ADC clock cycles. In this
        demo the ADC conversion clock is configured as the maximum frequency(Please
        refer the datasheet for the maximim value). So theoretically, sample rate
        = maximum frequency / total conversion time.
