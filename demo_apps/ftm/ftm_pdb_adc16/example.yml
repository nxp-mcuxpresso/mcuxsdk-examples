      brief: "The FTM / PDB demo application demonstrates how to use the FTM external\
        \ trigger to start the ADC conversion using thePDB. FTM0 is configured as\
        \ a complementary combined mode, and each channel output frequency is 16 KHz.\
        \ The complementarychannel dead time is 1 \xB5s. The PDB pre-trigger works\
        \ in back-to-back mode. The ADC0 and ADC1 work in single-end mode.The ADC0\
        \ uses channel 1 and channel 5, and ADC1 uses channel 1 and channel 7."
