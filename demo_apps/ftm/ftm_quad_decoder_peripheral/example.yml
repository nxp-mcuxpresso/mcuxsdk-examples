      brief: This demo describes the usage of Quad Decoder feature in FTM module,
        which can be used to count the position of decoder.An external decoder is
        used to generate the PHA and PHB's signal. These two signals are feed to the
        FTM pins with Quad Decoder feature (FTMx_QD_PHA and FTMx_QD_PHB). Then, the
        counter value and direction would be displayed in terminal window predically.
        You can open the mex file with MCUXpresso Config Tool to do further configuration
        of pin, clock and peripheral.
