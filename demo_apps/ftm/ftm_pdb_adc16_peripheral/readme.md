# ftm_pdb_adc16_peripheral

## Overview

The FTM / PDB demo application demonstrates how to use the FTM external trigger to start the ADC conversion using the
PDB. FTM0 is configured as a pwm combined mode, and each channel output frequency is 16 KHz.The PDB pre-trigger works 
in back-to-back mode. The ADC0 and ADC1 work in single-end mode.The ADC0 uses channel 9 and channel 26, and ADC1 uses 
channel 9 and channel 8.
