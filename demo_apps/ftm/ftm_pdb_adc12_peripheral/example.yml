      brief: This application demonstrates how to use the trigger signal generated
        by FTM to trigger the ADCconversion through PDB module.For instance, the FTM0
        is configured to work in PWM mode. And its channel 0 monitors the FTM counterand
        compares with the channel value. Once the FTM counter matches the channel
        value, an externaltrigger would be generated. TRGMUX would capture this trigger
        and route it to PDB module. When thePDB is triggered, the PDB counter increase.
        Once the PDB matches the ADC pre-trigger value, a triggersignal would generated
        and sent to ADC module. Finally, the ADC gets the trigger signal and start
        theconversion.You can open the mex file with MCUXpresso Config Tool to do
        further configuration of pin, clock and peripheral.
