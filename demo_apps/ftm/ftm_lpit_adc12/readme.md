# ftm_lpit_adc12

## Overview

This application demonstrates how to use the trigger signal generated by FTM to trigger the ADC
conversion through LPIT module.

For instance, the FTM0 is configured to work in PWM mode. And its channel 0 monitors the FTM counter
and compares with the channel value. Once the FTM counter matches the channel value, an external
trigger would be generated. TRGMUX would capture this trigger and route it to LPIT module. When the
LPIT is triggered, the LPIT counter increase. Once the LPIT matches the ADC pre-trigger value, a trigger
signal would generated and sent to ADC module. Finally, the ADC gets the trigger signal and start the
conversion.
