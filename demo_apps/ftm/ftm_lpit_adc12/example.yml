      brief: This application demonstrates how to use the trigger signal generated
        by FTM to trigger the ADCconversion through LPIT module.For instance, the
        FTM0 is configured to work in PWM mode. And its channel 0 monitors the FTM
        counterand compares with the channel value. Once the FTM counter matches the
        channel value, an externaltrigger would be generated. TRGMUX would capture
        this trigger and route it to LPIT module. When the LPIT is triggered, the
        LPIT counter increase. Once the LPIT matches the ADC pre-trigger value, a
        triggersignal would generated and sent to ADC module. Finally, the ADC gets
        the trigger signal and start theconversion.
