      brief: This demo application demonstrates the EflexPWM fault demo.This application
        demonstrates the pulse with modulation function of EflexPWM module. It outputs
        thePWM to control the intensity of the LED. PWM shut down when a fault signal
        is detected on the CMPoutput. One input of CMP, other input is from internal
        DAC.
