      brief: The ADC Low Power Demo project is a demonstration program that uses the
        KSDK software. Themicrocontroller is set to a very low power stop (VLPS) mode,
        and every 500 ms an interrupt wakes upthe ADC module and takes the current
        temperature sensor value of the microcontroller. While the temperature remains
        within boundaries, both LEDs are on. If the temperature is higher or lower
        thanaverage, a led comes off. This demo provides an example to show how ADC
        works during a VLPS mode anda simple debugging.
