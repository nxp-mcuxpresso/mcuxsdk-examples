      brief: The ADC Low Power demo application demonstrates the usage of the ADC
        peripheral while in a low power mode. Themicrocontroller is first set to very
        low power stop (VLPS) mode. Every 500 ms, an interrupt wakes up the ADC module
        andreads the current temperature of the microcontroller. While the temperature
        remains within boundaries, both LEDs are on.If the core temperature is higher
        or lower than average, the LEDs change state respectively.
