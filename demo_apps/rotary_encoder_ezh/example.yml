      brief: The rotary encoder ezh demo application provides introduction for Quad
        encode interface of LPC5500. The direction and counter can be got from the
        signals of phaseA and phaseB of encoder sensor. Rotary Y click carries a 15-pulse
        incremental rotary encoder with detents, surrounded by a ring of 16 yellow
        LEDs. The encoder signal can be analyzed by QEI of LPC5500. Along with the
        rotation, LED lights in different positions can be lit.
