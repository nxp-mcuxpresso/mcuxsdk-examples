# rotary_encoder_ezh

## Overview
The rotary encoder ezh demo application provides introduction for Quad encode interface of LPC5500.
The direction and counter can be got from the signals of phaseA and phaseB of encoder sensor.
Rotary Y click carries a 15-pulse incremental rotary encoder with detents, surrounded by a ring of 16 yellow LEDs.
The encoder signal can be analyzed by QEI of LPC5500. Along with the rotation, LED lights in different positions can be lit.
