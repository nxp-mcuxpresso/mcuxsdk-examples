      brief: The LED Blinky demo application provides a sanity check for the new SDK
        build environments and board bring up. The LED Blinky demo uses the systick
        interrupt to realize the function of timing delay. The example takes turns
        to shine the LED. The purpose of this demo is to provide a simple project
        for debugging and further development.
