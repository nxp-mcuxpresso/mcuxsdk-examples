# dac_adc_peripheral

## Overview

The DAC / ADC demo application demonstrates the use of the DAC and ADC peripherals. This application demonstrates how to
configure the DAC and set the output on the DAC. This demo also demonstrates how to configure the ADC in 'Blocking Mode'
and how to read ADC values.
The code of this demo has been prepared and updated for use with the MCUXpresso Configuration Tools (Pins/Clocks/Peripherals).
