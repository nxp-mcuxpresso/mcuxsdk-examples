# thermistor_lab

## Overview
This lab shows how to configure and use the ADC module to sample the differential voltage across onboard thermistors RT1-RT4.
If the user touches any on-board thermistor with a finger, the lab application detects a change in the thermistor temperature
and starts flashing the corresponding LED pair.
• The lab tutorial demonstrates:
  – how to configure ADC module to read differential inputs
  – how to filter and process ADC results
