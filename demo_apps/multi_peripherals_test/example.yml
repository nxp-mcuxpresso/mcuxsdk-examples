      brief: The multi-peripherals-test demo application does the basic peripheral
        test on board. This demo will test audio, usb, led, button, sdcard, accelerometer
        and rtc. To test audio function, connect an audio source, for example from
        a mobile phone or PC, to Line-IN connector, connect a headphone or speaker
        to Line-Out connector. Then the input audio can be heared in the headphone
        or speaker. To test usb, connect a USB cable between the PC and board's high
        speed connector, the cursor on the PC will move in a square pattern. To test
        sdcard function, insert a uSD memory card in to the connector, then the test
        result will be printed, please make sure the message is not a failed message.
        Please verify the green LED in the RGB-LED flashed with a 1Hz rate. This indicates
        that the RTC crystal works.
