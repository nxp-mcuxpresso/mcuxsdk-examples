      brief: This example describes how to use kinetis SDK drivers to implement LPI2C
        transmit and receive in the VLPS (very low power STOP mode) with async DMA.The
        LPI2C module is designed to have ability to work under low power module like
        STOP, VLPW and VLPS. It can use DMA to transmit the data from or to application
        user buffer without CPU interaction.It uses LPI2C to access the on board accelerometer
        sensor to read the Accelerometer X, Y, Z data every 500ms. CPU would keep
        in VLPS low power mode, except for some trigger events and data output to
        LPUART0.
