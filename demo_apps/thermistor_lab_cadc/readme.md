# thermistor_lab_cadc

## Overview
The Thermistor Lab Demo application demonstrates how to use PDB to trigger ADC and measure on-board thermistor.
This demo shows how to configure and use the ADC module to sample the differential voltage across onboard thermistors RT1-RT4.
If the user touches any on-board thermistor with a finger, the lab application detects a change in the thermistor temperature
and starts flashing the corresponding LED pair.
