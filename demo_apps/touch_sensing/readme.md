# touch_sensing

## Overview
The user interface of a product is a key element that design engineers need to address
to provide a compelling user experience. Touchpads, slides and rotaries offer 
a more intuitive and effective way of user interaction than traditional buttons. 
And, designing a touch-based user interface is simplified with the NXP Touch solution.
This solution includes software that is designed to work simply and seamlessly with 
NXP’s capacitive touch sensing hardware IP that’s available on Kinetis KE15Z/KE16Z/KE17Z/MCX-N9XX/MCX-N5XX MCUs.
Key benefits of the NXP Touch solution include:
- Robust EMC performance, noise immunity with IEC61000-4-6 standard certification with the 3V and 10V tests
- Self-cap and mutual-cap modes supporting up to 6x6 matrix touchpads
- Effective performance even with liquid substances such as water, salt water, oil, cold steam, etc.
- High sensitivity with a boost feature to use when the touch overlay on the user interface is thick (acrylic, glass)
