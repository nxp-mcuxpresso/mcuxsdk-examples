      brief: 'CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware
        making it reusable across a wide range of supported microcontroller devices.
        The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware that implements
        for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces.
        More information and usage methord please refer to http:/www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.The
        cmsis_uart_edma_transfer example shows how to use uart cmsis  driver with
        EDMA:In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board
        willsend back all characters that PC send to the board.Note: The example echo
        every 8 characters, so input 8 characters every time.'
