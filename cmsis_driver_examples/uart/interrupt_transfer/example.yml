      brief: 'CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware
        making it reusable across a wide range of supported microcontroller devices.
        The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware that implements
        for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces.
        More information and usage methord please refer to http:/www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.The
        cmsis_uart_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use uart cmsis driver in
        interrupt way:In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart,
        the board willsend back all characters that PC send to the board.Note: The
        example echo every 8 characters, so input 8 characters every time.'
