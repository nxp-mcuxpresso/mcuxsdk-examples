      brief: CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware
        making it reusable across a wide range of supported microcontroller devices.
        The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware that implements
        for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces.
        More information and usage methord please refer to http:/www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.The
        cmsis_spi_dma_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use spi driver as master
        to do board to board transfer with DMA:In this example, one spi instance as
        master and another spi instance on the other board as slave. Master sends
        a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example
        checks if the data received from slave is correct.
