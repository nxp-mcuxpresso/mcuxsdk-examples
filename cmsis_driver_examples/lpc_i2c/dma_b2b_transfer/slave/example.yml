      brief: CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware
        making it reusable across a wide range of supported microcontroller devices.
        The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware that implements
        for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces.
        More information and usage methord please refer to http:/www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.The
        cmsis_i2c_dma_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use i2c driver as slave
        to do board to board transfer with a DMA master:In this example, one i2c instance
        as slave and another i2c instance on the other board as master. Master sends
        a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example
        checks if the data received from slave is correct.
