      brief: CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware
        making it reusable across a wide range of supported microcontroller devices.
        The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware that implements
        for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces.
        More information and usage methord please refer to http:/www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.The
        cmsis_i2c_edma_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use i2c driver as slave
        to do board to board transfer with a EDMA master:In this example, one i2c
        instance as slave and another i2c instance on the other board as master. Master
        sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This
        example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
