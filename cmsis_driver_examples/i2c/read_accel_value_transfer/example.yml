      brief: 'CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware
        making it reusable across a wide range of supported microcontroller devices.
        The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware that implements
        for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces.
        More information and usage methord please refer to http:/www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.The
        cmsis_i2c_read_accel_value example shows how to use CMSIS I2C driver to communicate
        with an i2c device: 1. How to use the i2c driver to read a i2c device who_am_I
        register. 2. How to use the i2c driver to write/read the device registers.In
        this example, the values of three-axis accelerometer print to the serial terminal
        on PC throughthe virtual serial port on board.'
