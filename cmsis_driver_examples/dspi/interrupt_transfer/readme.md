# cmsis_dspi_interrupt_transfer

## Overview
CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware making it reusable across a wide 
range of supported microcontroller devices. The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware 
that implements for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces. 
More information and usage method please refer to http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.

The cmsis_dspi_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use CMSIS DSPI driver in interrupt way:
 
In this example , one dspi instance used as master and another dspi instance used as slave in the same board.
1. DSPI master send/received data to/from DSPI slave in edma . (DSPI Slave using edma to receive/send the data)

## Running the demo
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

CMSIS DSPI interrupt transfer example start.
This example use one dspi instance as master and another as slave on one board.
Master and slave are both use interrupt way.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
DSPI_master -- DSPI_slave
   CLK      --    CLK
   PCS      --    PCS
   SOUT     --    SIN
   SIN      --    SOUT
This is SlaveSignalEvent.

DSPI transfer all data matched!
