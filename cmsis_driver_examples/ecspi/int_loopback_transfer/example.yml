      brief: 'CMSIS-Driver defines generic peripheral driver interfaces for middleware
        making it reusable across a wide range of supported microcontroller devices.
        The API connects microcontroller peripherals with middleware that implements
        for example communication stacks, file systems, or graphic user interfaces.
        More information and usage methord please refer to http:/www.keil.com/pack/doc/cmsis/Driver/html/index.html.The
        cmsis_ecspi_int_loopback_transfer example shows how to use CMSIS ECSPI driver
        in interrupt way: In this example , ECSPI will do a loopback transfer in interrupt
        way, so, there is no need to set up any pins.And we should set the ECSPIx->TESTREG[LBC]
        bit, this bit is used in Master mode only. When this bit is set, the ECSPI
        connects the transmitter and receiver sections internally, and the data shifted
        out from the most-significant bit of the shift register is looped back into
        the least-significant bit of the Shift register.In this way, a self-test of
        the complete transmit/receive path can be made. The output pins are not affected,
        and the input pins are ignored.'
