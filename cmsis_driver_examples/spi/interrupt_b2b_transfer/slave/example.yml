      brief: 'The spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer example shows how to use SPI CMSIS driver
        in interrupt way:In this example , we need two boards, one board used as SPI
        master and another board used as SPI slave.The file ''spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer_slave.c''
        includes the SPI slave code.This example uses the transactional API in SPI
        driver.1. SPI master send/received data to/from SPI slave in interrupt . '
