      brief: 'The spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer example shows how to use spi CMSIS driver
        in interrupt way:In this example , we need two boards, one board used as spi
        master and another board used as spi slave.The file ''spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer_master.c''
        includes the spi master code.This example uses the transactional API in spi
        driver.1. spi master send/received data to/from spi slave in interrupt . '
