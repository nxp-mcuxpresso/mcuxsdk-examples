# cmsis_spi_dma_b2b_transfer_slave

## Overview
The spi_dma_b2b_transfer example shows how to use SPI CMSIS driver in dma way:

In this example , we need two boards, one board used as SPI master and another board used as SPI slave.
The file 'spi_dma_b2b_transfer_slave.c' includes the SPI slave code.

1. SPI master send/received data to/from SPI slave in dma .
