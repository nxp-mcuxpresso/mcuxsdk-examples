Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1010 board
- Personal Computer
- Two SPDIF RCA lines
- Soundcacrd support SPDIF interface

Board settings
============
Make sure J13 and J15 are on. Weld 10kÎ© resistor to R114.

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Connect J14 with SPDIF soundcard output inteface, connect J18 with SPDIF soundcard input interface.
3.  Playback music using the SPDIF soundcard, make the SPDIF signals input to MIMXRT1011 board.
4.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
5.  Download the program to the target board.
6.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
After run the demo, you can hear the music playbacked from SPDIF soundcacrd, the log below shows the output of the example in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPDIF example started!
SPDIF example finished!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
2. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J41.
3. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
