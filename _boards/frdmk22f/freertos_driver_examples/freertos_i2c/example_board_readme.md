Hardware requirements
===================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K22F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
=============
The example supports 2 different connections:
Using 1 FRDM-K22F board:
    The 2 I2C instances on one board are used, one as I2C master , another as I2C slave.
    The connection should be set as following:
        - J24-12 , J1-13 connected
        - J24-10 , J2-07 connected
Using 2 FRDM-K22F boards:
    The I2C0 module on one board is used as master. The I2C1 module on another board is used as slave.
    The connection should be se as following:
        - J24-12 (master board) connected to J1-13 (slave board).
        - J24-10 (master board) connected to J2-07 (slave board).

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.
    If using 1 FRDM-K22F board:
        Default settings in freertos_i2c.c is applied.
        Build project.
        Download the program to the target board.
    If using 2 FRDM-K22F boards:
        In file freertos_i2c.c in folder: boards\frdmk22f\rtos_examples\freertos_i2c, do following definition:
            #define EXAMPLE_CONNECT_I2C BOARD_TO_BOARD
            For master, use following definition
                #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isMASTER
                Build project.
                Download the program to one target board (used as master board).
            For slave, use following definition
                #define I2C_MASTER_SLAVE isSLAVE
                Build project.
                Download the program to one target board (used as slave board).
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
===============
When the example runs successfully:
If using 1 FRDM-K22F board, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.



==FreeRTOS I2C example start.==

This example use one i2c instance as master and another as slave on one board.
