NOTE: For generic step-by-step instructions, please see the User's Manual for the
EmSA CANopen (FD) Libraries for NXP SDKs, chapter "Getting Started"

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Two Micro USB cables
- Two LPCXpresso55S16 boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Between CAN transceivers:
- CANH, CANL, GND should be connected
The jumper setting:
    Default jumpers configuration does not work,  you will need to add JP20 and JP21 (JP22 optional for ADC use)
The resistor setting:
    R22 needs to solder 120 ohm resistor

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J1) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
1. First press the reset button on the board with the mco_slave example
2. Second press the reset button on the board with the mco_manager example
