Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55S16 board
- Personal Computer

# Board settings

```
Output signal		Board location
SCT0_OUT2    		J12-12
SCT0_OUT6    		J12-14
```
The jumper setting:
    Default jumpers configuration does not work,  you will need to add JP20 and JP21 (JP22 optional for ADC use)

# Prepare the Demo

1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J1) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the SCTimer driver simple PWM demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCTimer example to output 2 center-aligned PWM signals

Probe the signal using an oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll see center-aligned PWM signals on J12_12 and J12_14 using an oscilloscope.
