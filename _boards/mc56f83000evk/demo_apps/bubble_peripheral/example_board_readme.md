Overview
===================
The bubble level demo demonstrates basic usage of the on-board accelerometer to implement a bubble level. A bubble
level utilizes two axes to visually show deviation from a level plane (0 degrees) on a given axis.

The following files are generated by MCUXpresso Config Tools:
- peripheral.c/.h: These files are generated by MCUXpresso peripherals tool which could be imported back to the tool.
- clock_config.c/.h: These files are generated by MCUXpresso clocks tool which could be imported back to the tool.
- pin_mux.c/.h: These files are generated by MCUXpresso pins tool which could be imported back to the tool.

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MC56F83000-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board hardware common setting
=============================
1. Power setting:
   > Connect J19 pin2 and pin3
   > Connect J12 pin1 and pin2
   > Connect J13 pin1 and pin2
   > Connect J15 pin1 and pin2
   > Connect J16 pin2 and pin3
   > Connect J17 pin1 and pin2
2. Onboard OSJTAG debugger setting:
   > Leave J5 open
   > Leave J6 open
     Note: J6 is only used(connected) when firmware update for onboard debugger OSJTAG.
   > Connect J11 pin 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, to setup onboard debugger OSJTAG.
     Note: when use external debugger(connected to J10), leave all J11 pins open.

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB cable between the host PC and the JM60 USB(J8) port on the target board. It setups OSJTAG and COM port in PC device manager.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board with OSJTAG debug configuration.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo. 
    Please be noted that default FCF(flash configuration field) setting makes MCU boot from bootloader. So after reset button press,
    it will wait 5s(wait in bootloader) to run the application code.

Running the demo
===============

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar
information from the terminal as shown below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to the BUBBLE example

You will see the change of LED brightness when change angles of board

x=  6 y = 22
x=  8 y = 26
x= 10 y = 28
x= 10 y = 28
x= 11 y = 29
x= 11 y = 29
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:
- If the RED LED flashes constantly and the following message is printed on the console:
    Sensor device initialize failed!

    Please check the sensor chip U11

  please check if the combo sensor (U11) is presented on the board.
