LPUART 9-bit mode example begins
LPUART is configured with address, only data sent to itself after matched address can be received
LPUART will send first piece of data out:

0x 0  0x 1  0x 2  0x 3  0x 4  0x 5  0x 6  0x 7  
0x 8  0x 9  0x a  0x b  0x c  0x d  0x e  0x f  

LPUART will address itself
LPUART will send the other piece of data out:

0x10  0x11  0x12  0x13  0x14  0x15  0x16  0x17  
0x18  0x19  0x1a  0x1b  0x1c  0x1d  0x1e  0x1f  

LPUART received data:

0x10  0x11  0x12  0x13  0x14  0x15  0x16  0x17  
0x18  0x19  0x1a  0x1b  0x1c  0x1d  0x1e  0x1f  

All data matches!
