## Functional Description
The example will configure the SWM for PLU inputs, outputs, and clock input, then configure the PLU module
to make it work.

Note: The RGB LED in this case turns on when the pin level is low and it turns off when the pin level is high.

Each of the three LUT elements are connected to the three PLU input sources to control the RGB LED.

## Hardware Requirements
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso804 board
- Personal Computer

## Board Settings
PLU input pins connection:
- CN3_7 (GPIO0_8) to CN8_2 (PLU_IN2).
- CN3_6 (GPIO0_9) to CN3_10 (PLU_IN3).
- CN5_1 (GPIO0_10) to CN8_5 (PLU_IN4).

PLU output pins connection:
- CN3_1 (PLU_OUT0) to CN8_4 (LED_RED).
- CN3_8 (PLU_OUT1) to CN8_6 (LED_GREEN).
- CN5_2 (PLU_OUT2) to CN8_3 (LED_BLUE).

## Run the Project
1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP port(CN2 on the board).

2. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - 9600 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control

3. Choose an IDE, building the project and download the program to the target board.
   More information about how to compile and program the project can refer to the

   [Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK](../../../../docs/Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK.pdf).

4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

## Expected Result
Input source and LED status table:

 PLU_IN4 | PLU_IN3 | PLU_IN2 | LED_BLUE | LED_GREEN | LED_RED
---------|---------|---------|----------|-----------|---------
 0       | 0       | 0       | off      | off       | off
 0       | 0       | 1       | off      | off       | on
 0       | 1       | 0       | off      | on        | off
 0       | 1       | 1       | on       | off       | off
 1       | 0       | 0       | off      | on        | on
 1       | 0       | 1       | on       | off       | on
 1       | 1       | 0       | on       | on        | off
 1       | 1       | 1       | on       | on        | on

The log below shows the output of the plu combination example in the terminal window:
