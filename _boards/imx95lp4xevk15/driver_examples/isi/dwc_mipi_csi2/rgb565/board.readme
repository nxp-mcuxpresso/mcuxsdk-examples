Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- IMX95LP4XEVK-15 board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer
- LCD SPEC panel
- AP1302 sensor

Board settings
==============
For MIPI2HDMI card(1920*1080), connect MIPI_DSICSI port to MIPI2HDMI card(ADV7535) card.
For AP1302 sensor with MINISAS connect to MIPI-CSI(MINI SAS).
Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW4 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J31 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Note:
1. the ap1302 is an external isp, it need special firmware from OnSemi GitHub.
   pls download ap1302_60fps_ar0144_27M_2Lane_awb_tuning.bin from: https://github.com/ONSemiconductor/ap1302_binaries/tree/main/NXP_i.MX93
2. You can use Jlink or other method to load fw into memory.
   such as Jlink tool: 'connect' then select 'MIMX9594_M7' device, 'S' select SWD.
   loadbin "C:\***\ap1302_60fps_ar0144_27M_2Lane_awb_tuning.bin" 0x87000000
