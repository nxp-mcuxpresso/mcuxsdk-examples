Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- two IMX95LP4X-EVK board
- JLink Plus
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires connecting between CAN pins of two boards.
The connection should be set as follows:

Between two boards:
- J22-2(CANH) node A, J22-2(CANH) node B
- J22-3(CANL) node A, J22-3(CANL) node B
- J22-4(GND) node A, J22-4(GND) node B

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and JLink Plus to the board, switch SW4 to power on the board
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J31 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:
