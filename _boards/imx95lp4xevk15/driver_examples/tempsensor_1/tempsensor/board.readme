Hardware requirements
=====================
- Personal Computer
- IMX95LP4XBB-15-REV-A EVK board
- 12V~20V power supply
- J-Link Debug Probe
- Micro USB cable

Board settings
============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect the 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, and switch SW4 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J31 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either re-power up your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you will see similar information from the terminal shown below. Use some methods
to cool down the chip (such as air cooling). When the chip temperature is lower than the threshold, an interrupt will
be generated and relevant information will be printed to the terminal.
