- LPCXpresso55S06 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============

The keystore in PFR (Protected Flash Region) has to be created before this application is executed.
Newer devices have provisioned keystore from NXP factory. This means that PUF activation code is already present in NXP
programmed Key Store Area in FFR/PFR. Also device certificate and device private keys derived from activation key have
been programmed in NMPA area. In most cases, user can reuse PUF activation code stored in FFR to start the PUF, so it
is not necessary to perform PUF enroll again. In case that user application requires to have a separate PUF key store
which is independent on the NXP programmed key store, it is possible to enroll PUF again and store the new AC at user
defined location in non-volatile memory. 

It is strongly recommended to not update the PUF activation code provisioned from NXP factory!!
Device certificate and device private keys programmed by NXP in keystore area will become unusable.

You can check whether the Key Store has already been provisioned by checking valid value at the Key Store header in FFR. 

If your device is not provisioned, you can achieve it by following steps below:
Refer to the device user manual for more information about how to create the keystore.
The general steps are:
1. Install the JS3 jumper to allow the ISP mode after the reset.
2. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board.
3. Locate the middleware\mcu-boot\bin\Tools\blhost\win\blhost.exe file. If this PC tool is not available in your package,
   visit the https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com and build the MCUXpresso SDK package with the mcu-boot optional component again.    
4. Open the Command Prompt, move to the folder with the blhost.exe and apply the following commands 
   (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine comX number):
   blhost -p comX -- key-provisioning enroll 
   blhost -p comX -- key-provisioning set_key 7 16 
   blhost -p comX -- key-provisioning set_key 8 16 
   blhost -p comX -- key-provisioning set_key 9 16 
   blhost -p comX -- key-provisioning write_key_nonvolatile 0 
5. Remove the JS3 jumper and reset the board.

Note, the keystore is created once and if stored in NVM it is not necessary to apply above mentioned step before every run of the PRINCE example.

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the random number generator demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PRINCE Example.
PRINCE engine should be initialized by the bootloader at this point if the activation code is valid and the PUF Enroll had been performed. Here is the actual PRINCE configuration:
PRINCE region 0 base address: 0x0
PRINCE region 0 SR enable mask: 0x0
PRINCE region 1 base address: 0x0
PRINCE region 1 SR enable mask: 0x0
PRINCE region 2 base address: 0x0
PRINCE region 2 SR enable mask: 0x0

PRINCE was successfully configured for on-the-fly encryption/decryption from 0x30000 to 0x32000.

New PRINCE configuration:
PRINCE region 0 base address: 0x0
PRINCE region 0 SR enable mask: 0x0
PRINCE region 1 base address: 0x0
PRINCE region 1 SR enable mask: 0x1000000
PRINCE region 2 base address: 0x0
PRINCE region 2 SR enable mask: 0x0

Example end.
