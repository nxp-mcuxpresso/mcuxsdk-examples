EdgeLock 2GO Import Blob
=======================================================================

This demo demonstrates how to import the encrypted EdgeLock 2GO secure object blobs from Flash to the
ITS storage. The imported objects are used for executing crypto operations.

The workspace structure (when building this order must be respected):
- el2go_import_blob_s: project running in Secure processing environment (SPE)
- el2go_import_blob_ns: project running in Non-secure processing environment (NSPE)

The application requires to have encrypted EdgeLock 2GO secure object blobs loaded in Flash. This can be achieved
using offline provisioning via the spsdk tools (WIP).

Prerequisites
=======================================================================
- Active EdgeLock 2GO account (https://www.nxp.com/products/security-and-authentication/secure-service-2go-platform/edgelock-2go:EDGELOCK-2GO)
- Any Serial communicator

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  By default the validation of blobs is disabled; it can be enabled by setting to one the macro

    in file middleware/se_hostlib/nxp_iot_agent/ex/src/apps/psa_examples/el2go_import_blob/el2go_import_blob.h
    #define VALIDATE_PSA_IMPORT_OPERATION 0

2.  To correctly run the example, the secure boot mode on the device needs to be enabled. The bootheader needs to be removed
    from the SPE image, it has to be merged with the NSPE image and the resulting image must be signed with the OEM key.
    Additionaly, if the example is supposed to run in the OEM CLOSED life cycle, the image needs to be encrypted with
    the OEM FW encryption key and loaded as an SB3.1 container.
    Details on how to execute these steps can be found in the Application note AN14148 "Enabling Secure boot and Trust Provisioning on MCX N series", downloadable from
    https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-microcontrollers/general-purpose-mcus/mcx-arm-cortex-m/mcx-n-series-microcontrollers/mcx-n94x-54x-highly-integrated-multicore-mcus-with-on-chip-accelerators-intelligent-peripherals-and-advanced-security:MCX-N94X-N54X
    in the "Secure Files" section.

3.  [Optional] In order to maximize the TF-M ITS performance, the maximum supported blob size is set to 2908 bytes. In case
    the user wants to support bigger blobs (8K is the maximum size supported by PSA), he needs to change the following two variables:

    in file middleware/tfm/tf-m/platform/ext/target/nxp/$board$/config_tfm_target.h
    #define ITS_MAX_ASSET_SIZE                     3 * 0xC00

    in file middleware/tfm/tf-m/platform/ext/target/nxp/$board$/partition/flash_layout.h
    #define TFM_HAL_ITS_SECTORS_PER_BLOCK   (3)

4.  Compile the projects using the dedicated toolchain in the following order:
    - el2go_import_blob_s
    - el2go_import_blob_ns

5.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J7) on the board.
6.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
7. Download the program to the target board.
8. Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.
