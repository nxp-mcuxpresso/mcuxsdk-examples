NOTE: For generic step-by-step instructions, please see the User's Manual for the
EmSA CANopen (FD) Libraries for NXP SDKs, chapter "Getting Started"

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- MCX-N9XX-EVK Board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires 2 sets of boards, each of them is mounted with the base board.
To make example work, connections needed to be as follows on each base board:

Board to board connections needed to be as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Node A           connect to      Node B
Pin Name   Board Location         Pin Name    Board Location
CANH       J29-1                  CANH        J29-1
CANL       J29-2                  CANL        J29-2
GND        J29-4                  GND         J29-4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
1. First press the reset button on the board with the mco_slave example
2. Second press the reset button on the board with the mco_manager example
