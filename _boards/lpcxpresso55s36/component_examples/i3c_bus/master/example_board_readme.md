=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55S36 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
I3C one board:
  + Transfer data from MASTER_BOARD to SLAVE_BOARD of I3C interface, I3C0 pins of MASTER_BOARD are connected with
    I3C0 pins of SLAVE_BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER_BOARD        CONNECTS TO         SLAVE_BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name   Board Location
P0_9       J9-20              P0_9       J9-20
P0_24      J9-18              P0_24      J9-18
GND        J9-14              GND        J9-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect the jumper resistor R554 2-3.

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following message shows in the terminal if the example runs successfully.
