- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
Remove resistor between BH23 and BH24, Short BH22 and BH23. 

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
1.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

The following lines are printed to the serial terminal when the demo program is executed.

Configure DMIC

2. This example wakes up microcontroller on any voice activity.
   Speak on DMIC,you can see blinking GREEN LED. Also serial message "Going into sleep" and "Just woke up" will be transmitted.
