Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55S36 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
The switch for this examples is SW3 on the board (PIO0_17)

```
Output signal		Board location
SCT0_OUT0    		J10-5 (P1_4)
SCT0_OUT4    		J10-13(P1_17)
```

# Prepare the Demo

1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J1) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the SCTimer multi-state demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCTimer example to output edge-aligned PWM signal

When user presses a switch the PWM signal will be seen from Out 4
When user presses the switch again PWM signal on Out 4 will turn off
The PWM signal from Out 0 will remain active all the time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll see  PWM signals on J10-5 and J10-13 using an oscilloscope
