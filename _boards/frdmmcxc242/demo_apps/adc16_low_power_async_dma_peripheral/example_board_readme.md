Hardware requirements
===================
- USB-C cable
- FRDM-MCXC242 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
    the demo.

Running the demo
===============
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ADC LOW POWER ASYNC DMA PERIPHERAL DEMO
ADC16_DoAutoCalibration() Done.
ADC value: 15670
ADC value: 16634
ADC value: 16686
