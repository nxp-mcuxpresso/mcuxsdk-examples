Hardware requirements
=====================
- Two Micro USB cables
- Two LPCXpresso54628 boards
- CAN Transceiver
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Since LPCXpresso54628 has no CAN transceiver on board, extra circuits and CAN transceivers are needed.
The connection should be set as follows:
Between board and Transceiver:
- J10-2, transceiver RXD connected
- J10-4, transceiver TXD connected
Between CAN transceivers:
- CANH, CANL, GND should be connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
One board must be chosen as node A and the other board as node B. (Note: Node B should start first)
Data is sent continuously between node A and node B.

This message displays on the node A terminal:

Please select local node as A or B:
Note: Node B should start first.
