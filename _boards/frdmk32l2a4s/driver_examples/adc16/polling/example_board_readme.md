Hardware requirements
===================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K32L2A4S board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
Input analog signal to J4-11

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Connect external signal source to user-defined channel, defined by "DEMO_ADC16_USER_CHANNEL" in source code.
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
===============
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
