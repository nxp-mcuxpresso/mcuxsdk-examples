- MIMXRT1040-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================   
The log below shows the output of the hello world demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
hello world.

Note:
This example shows how to add in boot header and XIP in hyper flash. To download binary into hyper flash in MDK and boot from hyperflash directly, following steps are needed:
1. Select the target flexspi_nor_debug or flexspi_nor_release.
2. Compile the project.
3. Press F8 or click the download button, to program the application into hyper flash.
4. Set the SW7: 1 off 2 on 3 on 4 off, then power on the board
5. After power on the baord, program has already started to run, reset SW4 is recommended. 
 
Note:
To debug in hyper flash in MDK, following steps are needed:
1. Select the target flexspi_nor_debug or flexspi_nor_release.
2. Compile the project.
3. Press F8 or click the download button, to program the application into hyper flash.
4. Set the SW7: 1 off 2 on 3 on 4 off, then power on the board
5. Push SW4 to reset.
6. Start to debug.

Note:
To debug in hyper flash in MCUXpresso, following steps are needed:
1. Set the SW7: 1 off 2 on 3 on 4 off, then power on the board
2. Compile the project.
3. Start to debug.
