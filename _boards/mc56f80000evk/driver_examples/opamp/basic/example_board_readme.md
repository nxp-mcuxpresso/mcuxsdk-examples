Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB cable between the host PC and the J12 USB port on the target board. It setups Multilink and COM port in PC device manager.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board with Multilink debug configuration.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
Input signal(0-1.65v) to J2-13(feed to GB1, OPAMPB CH0).
Use a multimeter to measure the voltage of TP19, the output voltage is about twice the input voltage.
