Overview
========
The power_mode_comp_only demo application demonstrates how to change power modes in the SDK when only Compute CPUs are used, and CPU1 is not used by your application. 
Since the SOC power states are determined by both SLEEPCON0, PMC0 from Compute and SLEEPCON1, PMC1 from Sense domain, even the CPU1 is not used, it should be booted
and correctly configured to alow CPU0 switch between various power modes.
