Hardware requirements
=====================
- 2 x Micro USB cable
- MC56F81000-EVK board
- Personal Computer

Board hardware common setting
=============================
1. Power setting:
   > Connect J8 pin2 and pin3
   > Connect J5 pin1 and pin2
   > Connect J6 pin1 and pin2
2. Onboard PnE U-MultiLink debugger setting:
   > Connet J11 pin2 and pin3
   > Connect J13 pin 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, to setup onboard debugger PnE U-MultiLink.
     Note: when use external debugger(connected to J10), leave all J13 pins open.

Board settings
==============
  MASTER_BOARD connects to SLAVE_BOARD as below:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  MASTER_BOARD        CONNECTS TO         SLAVE_BOARD
  Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name   Board Location
  I2C0_SCL   J2-20              I2C0_SCL   J2-20
  I2C0_SDA   J2-18              I2C0_SDA   J2-18
  GND        J2-14              GND        J2-14
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB cable between the host PC and the USB(J26) port on the target board to setup USB to UART bridge.
2.  Connect USB cable between the host PC and the USB(J12) port on the target baord to setup mulitlink debugger.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board with PnE U-MultiLink debug configuration.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.
    Please be noted default FCF(flash configuration field) makes the MCU boot from flash.

Running the demo
================

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
