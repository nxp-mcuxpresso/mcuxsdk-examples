Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54S018M board
- Personal Computer
- Loopback network cable RJ45 standard (optional)

Board settings
============
For LPCXpresso54S018M V2.0:JP11, JP12, JP14 and JP15 1-2 on..

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
This demo is an external flash plain load demo, ROM will copy image in external flash to SRAMX to run:
1. Build the demo to generate a bin file.
   Note: If need to generate bin file using MCUXpresso IDE, below steps need to be followed:
         Set in example Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Build steps->Post-build steps->Edit
         enbable arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O binary "&{BuildArtifactFileName}" "&{BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin"

         This plainload example linked the vector table to 0x00000000, but program to external flash 0x10000000.

2. Program the bin file to external on board flash via SEGGER J-FLASH Lite(V6.22 or higher):

   a. Open SEGGER J-FLASH Lite, select device LPC54S018M.

   b. Click the 'Erase Chip' to erase the extrenal flash.(if can not success, press SW4 button and reset the board, and try to erase again)

   c. Select the bin data file, set the '.bin/Erase Start' address to 0x10000000, then click 'Program Device'
Note: Please use above way to program the binary file built by armgcc tool chain to external flash.
      For IAR, KEIL, MCUXpresso IDE, you can use the IDE tool to program the external flash.
The log below shows example output of the example in the terminal window:

Optionally, you may use a loop back cable
====================================
Make a loopback network cable:
      568B standard 	 Unknowed standard
J1    orange+white       green+white
J2    orange             green
J3    green+white        orange+white
J4    blue               brown+white
J5    blue+white         brown
J6    green              orange
J7    brown+white        blue
J8    brown              blue+white

Connect J1 => J3, J2 => J6, J4 => J7, J5 => J8. 10/100M transfer only requires J1, J2, J3, J6, and 1G transfer requires all 8 pins.
Check your net cable color order and refer to the 568B standard or the other standard. If your cable's color order is not showed in the list,
please connect J1~J8 based on your situation.

1.  Add #define EXAMPLE_USES_LOOPBACK_CABLE 1  into app.h and rebuild the example.
2.  Insert loopback network cable to Ethernet RJ45 port.
3.  Run the demo in the same way as described earlier.
