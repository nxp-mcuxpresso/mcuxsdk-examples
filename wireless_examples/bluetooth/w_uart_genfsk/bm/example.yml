      brief: The Hybrid (Dual-Mode) Bluetooth Low Energy and Generic FSK application demonstrates 
        Generic FSK transmission/reception and Bluetooth advertising/scanning/multiple connections 
        coexistence.The Bluetooth LE part of this demo implements a modified version of the 
        Wireless UART demo application, capable of multiple Bluetooth LE connections.Based on the 
        Hardware link-layer implementation, the Bluetooth Low Energy has a higher priority than the 
        Generic FSK protocol and as the effect, the Generic FSK communication is executed during the 
        Idle states (inactive periods) of the Bluetooth LE. The coexistence of the two protocols is 
        handled internally at the Controller level.
