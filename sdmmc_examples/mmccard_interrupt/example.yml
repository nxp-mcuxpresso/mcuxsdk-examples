      brief: The MMCCARD Interrupt project is a demonstration program that uses the
        SDK software. It reads/writes/erases the MMC card continusly. The purpose
        of this example is to show how to use MMCCARD driver andshow how to use interrupt
        based transfer API in SDK software driver to access MMC card.Note:User can
        use MMC plus card or emmc(on board IC, but not recommand use emmc socket,due
        to high speed timing restriction)
