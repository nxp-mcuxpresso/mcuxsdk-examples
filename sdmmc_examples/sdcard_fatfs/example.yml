      brief: The SDCARD FATFS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK
        software. Tt mounts a file system based on a SD card then does "creat directory/read
        directory/create file/write file/read file"operation. The file sdhc_config.h
        has default SDHC configuration which can be adjusted to let carddriver has
        different performance. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD
        driver based FATFS disk in SDK software.
