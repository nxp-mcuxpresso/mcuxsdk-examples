      brief: The MMCCARD FATFS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK
        software. Tt mounts a file system based on a MMC card then does "creat directory/read
        directory/create file/write file/read file" operation. The file sdhc_config.h
        has default SDHC configuration which can be adjusted to letcard driver has
        different performance. The purpose of this example is to show how to use MMCCARD
        driver based FATFS disk in SDK software.Note:User can use MMC plus card or
        emmc(on board IC, but not recommand use emmc socket,due to high speed timing
        restriction)
