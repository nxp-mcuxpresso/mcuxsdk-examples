# pf3000

## Overview
The pf3000 driver example demonstrates the usage of pf3000 SDK component driver.
The example shows the usage of PF3000 API to:
1. Set regulator output voltages;
2. Query regulator output voltages;
3. Process interrupt raised by PF3000;
4. Dump PF3000 register content.

To use this example, user need to pay attention the output voltage when update the regulator
output and make sure the output voltage to set will not cause hardware damage.
