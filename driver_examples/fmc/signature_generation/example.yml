      brief: The fmc example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK
        software to generate flash signaturefor a specified flash address range and
        prints them to the terminal. This example also implements the softwaresignature
        algorithm, compares the hardware signature result and software signature result.
        This is to verify flash contents as suggested by user manual.
