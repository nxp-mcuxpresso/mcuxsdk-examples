# tsi_v2_low_power

## Overview
The tsi_v2_low_power example shows how to use TSI_V2 driver in low power modes:

In this example , we make use of the available electrodes on board to show driver usage.
1. Then, we start the Hardware-Trigger scan using interrupt method to wakeup from low power
   modes through pad touch;
2. Note: you can select which low power mode you want to enter into.

## Running the demo
When running successfully, the log output in terminal shall be similar as below:
