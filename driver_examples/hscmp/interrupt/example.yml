      brief: The HSCMP interrupt Example shows how to use interrupt with HSCMP driver.In
        this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal
        (can be controlled by user) as the HSCMP's positive channel input. On the
        negative side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage
        abouthalf value of reference voltage.When running the project, change the
        input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would
        changebetween logic one and zero when the user-defined channel's voltage crosses
        the internal DAC's value. The change ofcomparator's output would generate
        the falling and rising edge events with their interrupts enabled. When any
        HSCMP interrupt happens, the HSCMP's ISR would turn on the LED light if detecting
        the output's rising edge, or turn off it whendetecting the output's falling
        edge.
