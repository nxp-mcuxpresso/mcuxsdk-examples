      brief: The PWM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK PWM driver.The
        pulse width modulator (PWM) module contains PWM submodules, each of which
        is set up to control a single half-bridge power stage.Fault channel support
        is provided. This PWM module can generate various switching patterns, including
        highly sophisticated waveforms.It can be used to control all known Switched
        Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) topologies.
