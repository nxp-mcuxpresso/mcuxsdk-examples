      brief: The IAP flash project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK IAP
        driver. It provides some flash operations with ROM API, such as using a complete
        FlexSPI NOR Configuration Block to configure the flash, erasing sectors and
        programing pages. All operations are followed by flash memory check to ensure
        the data operated are successful.
