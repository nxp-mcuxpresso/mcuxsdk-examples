      brief: The ACMP Round-Robin project is a simple demonstration program that uses
        the SDK software. Usermust set the round-robin mode trigger in specific board
        properly according to the board resourcebefore running the example. When the
        example running, it sets positive port as fixed channel andinternal DAC output
        as comparison reference in positive port and sets the channels input by useras
        round-robin checker channel. The example will enter stop mode and wait user
        to change the voltageof round-robin checker channel. It will exit stop mode
        after the voltage of round-robin checkerchannel changed by user.
