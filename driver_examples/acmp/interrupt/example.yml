      brief: 'The ACMP Interrupt project is a simple demonstration program that uses
        the SDK software. Itcompares the selected analog input with ACMP internal
        DAC output continuously and toggle the LEDwhen the final comparison result
        changed. The purpose of this demo is to show how to use theACMP driver in
        SDK software by interrupt way. The ACMP can be configured based on defaultconfiguration
        returned by the API ACMP_GetDefaultConfig(). The default configuration is:
        highspeed is not enabled, invert output is not enabled, unfiltered output
        is not enabled, pin outis not enabled, offset level is level 0, hysteresis
        level is level 0.'
