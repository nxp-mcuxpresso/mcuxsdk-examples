      brief: 'The ACMP Polling project is a simple demonstration program that uses
        the SDK software. It comparesthe selected analog input with ACMP internal
        DAC output continuously and toggle the LED when thefinal comparison result
        changed. The purpose of this demo is to show how to use the ACMP driverin
        SDK software by polling way. The ACMP can be configured based on default configuration
        returnedby the API ACMP_GetDefaultConfig(). The default configuration is:
        high speed is not enabled, invertoutput is not enabled, unfiltered output
        is not enabled, pin out is not enabled, offset level islevel 0, hysteresis
        level is level 0.'
