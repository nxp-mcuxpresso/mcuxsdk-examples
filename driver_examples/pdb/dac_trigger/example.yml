      brief: The pdb_dac_trigger example shows how to use the PDB to generate a DAC
        trigger.Based on the basic counter, to use the DAC trigger, just to enable
        the DAC trigger's "milestone" and set the user-defined value for it.The DAC's
        "milestone" is called as "interval". Multiple DAC trigger intervals can be
        included into one PDB counter's cycle.DAC trigger's counter would reset after
        the trigger is created and start counting again to the interval value.In this
        example, the DAC is configured with hardware buffer enabled in normal work
        mode. Once it gets the trigger from the PDB, the buffer read pointer increases.
