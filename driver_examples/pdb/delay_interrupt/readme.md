# pdb_delay_interrupt

## Overview

The pdb_delay_interrupt example show how to use the PDB as a general programmable interrupt timer.

The PDB is triggered by software, and other external triggers are generated from PDB in this project,
so that user can see just a general counter is working with interrupt.
