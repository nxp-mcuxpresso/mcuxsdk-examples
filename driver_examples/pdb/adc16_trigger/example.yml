      brief: The pdb_adc16_trigger example shows how to use the PDB to generate a
        ADC trigger.Based on the basic counter, to use the ADC trigger, just to enable
        the ADC trigger's "milestone" and set the user-defined value for it.After
        the PDB counter is triggered to start, when the counter pass the "milestone",
        the ADC's Pre-Trigger would begenerated and sent to the ADC module.In this
        example, the ADC16 is configured with hardware trigger and conversion complete
        interrupt enabled.Once it gets the trigger from the PDB, the conversion goes,
        then the ISR would be executed.
