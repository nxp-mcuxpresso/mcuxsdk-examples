      brief: The flexcan_ping_pong_buffer_transfer example shows how to use the FlexCAN
        queue feature to create 2 simulate FIFOs that can receive CAN frames:In this
        example, 2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send
        CAN messages to Endpoint B(board B) when user input the number of CAN messages
        to be send in terminal. Endpoint B uses two receiving queues to receive messages
        in turn, and prints the message content and the receiving queue number to
        the terminal after any queue is full.
