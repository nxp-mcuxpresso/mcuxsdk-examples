      brief: The flexcan_legacy_fifo_edma_transfer example shows how to use the EDMA
        version transactional driver to receive CAN Message from Legacy Rx FIFO. In
        this example, when set ENABLE_LOOPBACK macro, only one board is needed. The
        example will config one FlexCAN Message Buffer as Tx Message Buffer and setup
        Legacy Rx FIFO. After that, example will send 6 CAN Messages from Tx Message
        Buffer to Legacy Rx FIFO through internal loopback interconnect and read them
        out using EDMA version FlexCAN transactional driver. The send and received
        message will be print out to terminal. When not define ENABLE_LOOPBACK, need
        2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message
        to Endpoint B(board B) when user press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receive
        the message by Legacy Rx FIFO and read them out using EDMA version FlexCAN
        transactional driver. The send and received message will be print out to terminal.
