      brief: The flexcan_remote_request example shows how to use remote request feature by SDK driver.
        In this example, 2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Board A send a remote frame to request
        message from board B. After successful request, board A will receive response message with same
        mailbox as transmit mailbox. Board B receive remote frame and send response message automatically,
        but do not save remote frame. After successful response, board B will increase response message
        and wait for next remote request.
