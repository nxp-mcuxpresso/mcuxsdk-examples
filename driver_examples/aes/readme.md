# aes

## Overview

The AES Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to encrypt plain text
and decrypt it back using AES algorithm. CBC and GCM modes are demonstrated.

## Running the demo
The log below shows example output of the AES driver demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
