      brief: The lpadc_edma example shows how to use ADC to trigger a DMA transfer.
        In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal(can
        be controlled by user) as the LPADC's sample input and active the low power
        timer to trigger the ADC conversion upon the set Time reached(can be changed
        by user). A programmable watermark threshold supports configurable notification
        of data availability. When FCTRLn[FCOUNT] is greater than FCTRLn[FWMARK],
        the associated RDY flag is asserted which would generate a DMA request and
        trigger the eDMA to move the ADC conversion result from ADC result FIFO to
        user indicated memory. Then the major loop waits for the transfer to be done.
        The results would be printed on terminal when any key pressed.
