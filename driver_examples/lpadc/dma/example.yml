      brief: The lpdc_dma example shows how to use ADC to trigger a DMA transfer.
        In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal
        (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC's sample input. When running the
        project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion, the
        software trigger API is called to start the conversion. When the ADC conversion
        is completed, it would trigger the DMA in ping-pong transfer mode to move
        the ADC conversion result from ADC conversion data register to user indicated
        memory. Then the main loop waits for the transfer to be done and print the
        result to terminal.
