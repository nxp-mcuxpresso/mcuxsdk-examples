      brief: The lpit_adc example shows how to use LPIT to generate ADC triggers.
        On top of the basic counter, to use the ADC trigger, simply enable the "milestone"
        of the ADC trigger and set it with a user-defined value. When the LPIT counter
        is on, when the count passes the "milestone", a pre-trigger of the ADC is
        generated and sent to the ADC module. In this example, the ADC is configured
        with hardware triggering and conversion complete interrupt enabled. Once it
        gets a trigger from the LPIT, the transition occurs and then the ISR is executed.
