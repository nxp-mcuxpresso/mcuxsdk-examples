      brief: The lpadc_dual_single_ended_conversion example shows how to use two channel
        with LPADC driver. In this example, user should indicate two channel to provide
        a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC's sample input,
        Channel B does not need to be paired with Channel A, Channel B is user selectable.When
        running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion.
        The execution would check the FIFO valid flag in loop until the flag is asserted,
        which means the conversion is completed. Then read the conversion result value
        and print it to debug console.
