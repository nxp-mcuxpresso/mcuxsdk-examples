      brief: The lpadc_light_sensor example shows how to use the LPADC driver to measure
        the voltage value in the circuit with a light sensor. In this example, the
        specific ADC channel has been connected into the circuit by board design.
        When running the project, typing any key into the debug console would trigger
        the conversion. The execution would check the FIFO valid flag in a loop until
        the flag is asserted, which means the conversion is completed. Then read the
        conversion result value and print it to the debug console.
