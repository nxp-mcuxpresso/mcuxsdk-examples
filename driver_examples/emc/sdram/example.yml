      brief: The emc_sdram example shows how to access the SDRAM.In this example,
        user shall initialize the EMC (external memory controller), initialize theEMC
        dynamic memory controller before access the external SDRAM.If the sdram example
        fails, please make sure to check the following points:1. Please take refer
        to the board.readme to check the jumper settings on your board.2. Please take
        refer to the EMC chapter in API RM to do the delay calibration to found the
        best delay for your board, then update the delay to the EMC clock delay control
        registers in the system configure module registers.
