      brief: The CMP interrupt Example shows how to use interrupt with CMP driver.In
        this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal
        (can be controlled by user) as the CMP's positive channel input. On the negative
        side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage abouthalf
        value of reference voltage.When running the project, change the input voltage
        of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would changebetween
        logic one and zero when the user-defined channel's voltage crosses the internal
        DAC's value. The change ofcomparator's output would generate the falling and
        rising edge events with their interrupts enabled. When any CMP interrupt happens,
        the CMP's ISR would turn on the LED light if detecting the output's rising
        edge, or turn off it whendetecting the output's falling edge.
