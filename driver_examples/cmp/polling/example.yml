      brief: The CMP polling Example shows the simplest way to use CMP driver and
        help user with a quick start.In this example, user should indicate an input
        channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the CMP's
        positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used
        to generate the fixed voltage abouthalf value of reference voltage.When running
        the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's
        output would changebetween logic one and zero when the user's voltage crosses
        the internal DAC's value. The endless loop in main() functionwould detect
        the logic value of comparator's output, and change the LED. The LED would
        be turned on when the compareoutput is logic one, or turned off when zero.
