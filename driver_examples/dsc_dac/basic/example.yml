      brief: The dsc_dac_basic example shows how to use DAC module simply as the general
        DAC converter. When the DAC's synchronous conversion mode is not selected,
        when the digital value is written to the DAC's buffered data register, the
        data can be immediately presented to the DAC and converted to an analog output.
        The DAC output voltage can be measured on DAC output pin.
