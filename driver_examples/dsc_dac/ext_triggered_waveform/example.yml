      brief: The dsc_dac_ext_triggered_waveform example shows how to use DAC module
        simply as the waveform generator. DAC's synchronous conversion mode is selected,
        and the data in buffered data register will be refreshed every cycle of the
        input signal. The sawtooth waveform can be measured on DAC output pin.
