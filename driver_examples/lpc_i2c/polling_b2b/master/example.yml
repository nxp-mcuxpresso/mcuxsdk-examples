      brief: The i2c_polling_b2b_master example shows how to use i2c driver as master
        to do board to board transfer using polling method:In this example, one i2c
        instance as master and another i2c instance on the other board as slave. Master
        sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This
        example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
