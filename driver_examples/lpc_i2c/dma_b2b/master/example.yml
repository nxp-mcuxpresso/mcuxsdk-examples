      brief: The i2c_dma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use i2c driver as
        master to do board to board transfer with DMA:In this example, one i2c instance
        as master and another i2c instance on the other board as slave. Master sends
        a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example
        checks if the data received from slave is correct.
