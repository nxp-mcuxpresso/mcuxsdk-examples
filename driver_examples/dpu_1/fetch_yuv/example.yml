      brief: The DPU Fetch Yuv example shows how to use the DPU driver to enable fetch
        Yuv unit and the scaler. The fetch yuv output frame size is smaller than desired
        output, so the scaler units are used for the frame size convert. If this example
        runs success, rectangles will move in the screen.
