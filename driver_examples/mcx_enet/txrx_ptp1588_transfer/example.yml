      brief: 'The enet_rxtx_ptp1588_transfer example shows the way to use ENET driver
        to   receive and transmit frame in the 1588 feature required cases.1. This
        example shows how to initialize the ENET.2. How to get the time stamp of the
        PTP 1588 timer.3. How to use Get the ENET transmit and receive frame time
        stamp.The example transmits 20 number PTP event frame, shows the timestamp
        of the transmitted frame.The length, source MAC address and destination MAC
        address of the received frame will be print. The time stamp of the received
        timestamp will be print when the PTP message frame is received(the outside
        loopback cable can be used to see the right rx time-stamping log since we
        send the ptp message). '
