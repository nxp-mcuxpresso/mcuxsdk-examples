      brief: Demonstrates the DMIC working with I2S. Audio is converted to samples
        in the DMIC module.Then, the data is placed into the I2S buffer. Last, it
        is read from the I2S buffer and sentto the CODEC, then the audio data will
        be output to Lineout of CODEC.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
