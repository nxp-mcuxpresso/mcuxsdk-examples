      brief: The fourWireModeInterrupt example shows how to use TSC driver in 4-wire
        interrupt modes:The touch screen controller needs to co-work with ADC and
        TSC analogue.In this example , we make use of the available electrodes on
        board to show driver usage.1. Firstly, before TSC starts work, ADC driver
        configure ADC_HCx;2. Then, we configure TSC module to work in non-auto-measure
        mode.3. Then, we start screen detection and wait for software order after
        detects a touch (and generates an interrupt);4. Then, we start measure during
        detect interruption.5. Then, we judge whether the measure data is valid during
        measure interruption.6. Lastly, if measure data is valid, serial terminal
        prints x/y-coordinate information.
