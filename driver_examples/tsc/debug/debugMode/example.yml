      brief: The fourWireModeInterrupt example shows how to use TSC driver in 4-wire
        debug modes:The touch screen controller needs to co-work with ADC and TSC
        analogue.In this example , we make use of the available electrodes on board
        to show driver usage.1. Firstly, before TSC starts work, ADC driver configure
        ADC_HCx;2. Then, we configure TSC module to work in debug mode.3. Then, we
        configure six states(1st-pre-charge, 1st-detect, x-measure, y-measure, and    2nd-pre-charge,
        2nd-detect) to simulate non-debug(hardware) mode.4. Lastly, if measure data
        is valid, serial terminal prints x/y-coordinate information.
