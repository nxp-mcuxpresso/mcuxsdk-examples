      brief: The lin_master demo application demonstrates how to use LIN bus signal
        transfer from slave node.This demo application is expected to work with another
        LIN instance implemented as master node on the other board. Slave is waiting
        for master to initialize the communication then exchange a response as signal
        represented by the character array. This demo uses auto-baudrate feature.
