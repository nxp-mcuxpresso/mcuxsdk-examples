      brief: The lin_master demo application demonstrates how to use LIN bus signal
        transfer from master node.This demo application is expected to work with another
        LIN instance implemented as slave node on the other board. Master node repeatedly
        initializes transfer by generating frame header, master and slave then exchange
        response as signal represented by the character array. This demo uses auto-baudrate
        feature.
