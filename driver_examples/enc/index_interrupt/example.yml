      brief: 'The enc_index_interrupt example shows how to use the interrupt of ENC
        module with ENC driver.In this example, user needs to connect a real encoder
        to the board. Actually, only PHASE A and PHASE B are enough for the basic
        application. However, the additional INDEX/HOME/TRIGGER could be used as the
        event detector. INDEX: This pulse can optionally reset the position counter
        and the pulse accumulator of the quadrature decoder module. It also causes
        a change of state on the revolution counter. The direction of this change,
        increment or decrement, is calculated from the PHASEA and PHASEB inputs.HOME:
        This input can be used to trigger the initialization of the position counters.
        Often this signal is connected to a sensor signalling the motor or machine,
        sending notification that it has reached a defined home position.TRIGGER:
        This input can be used to clear the position counters or to take a snapshot
        of the POS, REV, and POSD registers. Often this signal is connected to a periodic
        pulse generator or timer to indicate an elapsed time period.This example uses
        INDEX to response the external event. When running the project, user can turn
        the encoder so that ENC module can monitor the position change. Also, a variable
        counter would count the time of INDEX interrupt for rising edge on INDEX signal
        line.'
