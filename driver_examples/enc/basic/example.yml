      brief: The enc_basic example shows how to quickly start using ENC driver.In
        this example, user needs to connect a real encoder to the board. Actually,
        only PHASE A and PHASE B are enough for the basic application. When running
        the project, user can turn the encoder so that ENC module can monitor the
        position change. Then, the internal counter would also count for the position.
        User can also type keys into terminal, and the current position values recorded
        by ENC would display. The ENC hardware is created with a special synchronize
        mechanism. There are actually 4 counters (the 32-bit position counter is combined
        with the two 16-bit counter registers) for position with responding hold registers.
        When any of the counter registers is read, the contents of each counter register
        is written to the corresponding hold register. Taking a snapshot of the counters'
        values provides a consistent view of a system position and a velocity to be
        attained.
