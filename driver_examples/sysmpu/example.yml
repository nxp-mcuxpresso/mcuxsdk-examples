      brief: The SYSMPU example defines protected/unprotected memory region for the
        core access.First, the SYSMPU will capture the hardware information and show
        it on theterminal. Then, a memory region is configured as the non-writable
        region. Thebus fault interrupt is enabled to report the memory protection
        interrupt eventfor this non-writable region. If an operation writes to this
        region, the busfault interrupt happens. Then the bus fault interrupt handler
        provides aprevention alert by outputting a message on terminal, then the write
        rightswill be given to this region for core access. After the write access
        enabled,the writing to the region becomes successful. When the bus fault happen,
        thedetails of the error information will be captured and printed on the terminal.This
        example provides the terminal input control to give the example show for several
        regions access test. Just press any key to the terminal when theterminal show
        "Press any key to continue".
