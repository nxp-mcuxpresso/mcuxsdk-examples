      brief: 'The pee_bpli example shows how to use MCG driver to change from PEE
        mode to BLPI mode: 1. How to use the mode functions for MCG mode switch. 2.
        How to use the frequency functions to get current MCG frequency. 3. Work flow    Boot
        to PEE mode from default reset mode    Change mode PEE -> PBE ->FBE -> FBI
        -> BLPI    Change back BLPI -> FBI -> FBE -> PBE -> PEE    Get System clock
        in PEE mode to blink LEDIn this example, because the debug console''s clock
        frequency may change,so the example running information is not output from
        debug console. Here theLED blinks to show that the example finished successfully.'
