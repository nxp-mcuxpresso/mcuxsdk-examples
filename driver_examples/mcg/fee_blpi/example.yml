      brief: 'The fee_bpli example shows how to use MCG driver to change from FEE
        mode to BLPI mode: 1. How to use the mode functions for MCG mode switch. 2.
        How to use the frequency functions to get current MCG frequency. 3. Work flow    Boot
        to FEE mode from default reset mode    Change from FEE -> FBI -> BLPI    Change
        back BLPI -> FBI -> FEE    Get System clock in FEE mode to blink LEDIn this
        example, because the debug console''s clock frequency may change,so the example
        running information is not output from debug console. Here theLED blinks to
        show that the example finished successfully.'
