      brief: 'The fei_bpli example shows how to use MCG driver to change from FEI
        mode to BLPI mode: 1. How to use the mode functions for MCG mode switch. 2.
        How to use the frequency functions to get current MCG frequency. 3. Work flow    Boot
        to FEI mode from default reset mode    Change mode FEI -> FBI -> BLPI    Change
        back BLPE -> FBI -> FEI    Get System clock in FEI mode to blink LEDIn this
        example, because the debug console''s clock frequency may change,so the example
        running information is not output from debug console. Here theLED blinks to
        show that the example finished successfully.'
