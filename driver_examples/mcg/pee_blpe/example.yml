      brief: 'The pee_bple example shows how to use MCG driver to change from PEE
        mode to BLPE mode: 1. How to use the mode functions for MCG mode switch. 2.
        How to use the frequency functions to get current MCG frequency. 3. Work flow    Boot
        to PEE mode from default reset mode    Change mode PEE -> PBE -> BLPE    Change
        back BLPE -> PBE -> PEE    Get System clock in PEE mode to blink LEDIn this
        example, because the debug console''s clock frequency may change,so the example
        running information is not output from debug console. Here theLED blinks to
        show that the example finished successfully.'
