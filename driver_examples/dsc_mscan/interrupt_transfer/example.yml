      brief: The mscan_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use MSCAN driver in
        none-blocking interrupt way:To demonstrates this example, In this example,
        2 boards are connected through CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message
        to Endpoint B(board B) when user press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receive
        the message, print the message content to terminal and echo back the message.
        Endpoint A will increase the received message and waiting for the next transmission
        of the user initiated.
