# pwt_example

## Overview
The PWT project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK PWT driver. It sets up the PWT
hardware block to edge detection, capture control part and detects measurement trigger edges and
controls when and which pulse width register(s) will be updated. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print overflow flag status, positive pulse width and negative pulse width.
