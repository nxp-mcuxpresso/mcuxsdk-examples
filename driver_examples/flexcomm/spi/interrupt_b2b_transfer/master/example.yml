      brief: The spi_interrupt_board2board_master example shows how to use spi driver
        as master to do board to board transfer withinterrupt:In this example, one
        spi instance as master and another spi instance on othereboard as slave. Master
        sends a piece ofdata to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This
        example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
