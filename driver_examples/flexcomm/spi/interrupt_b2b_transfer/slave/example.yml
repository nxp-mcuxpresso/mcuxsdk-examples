      brief: The spi_interrupt_board2board_slave example shows how to use spi driver
        as slave to do board to board transfer with interrupt:In this example, one
        spi instance as slave and another spi instance on other board as master. Master
        sends a piece ofdata to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This
        example checks if the data received from master is correct.
