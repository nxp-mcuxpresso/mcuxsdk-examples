      brief: 'The spi_half_duplex_polling_transfer_slave example shows how to receive
        and transmit data to master board.Notice: The SPI slave of this example uses
        interrupt mode. The data transfer size(not buffer size) is twice ofthe master''s
        transfer size. The first half of the transmission will receive data, and the
        second half will senddata back to master, so the address of the receive buffer
        is &rxDataPolling[64].In this example, one spi instance as slave and another
        spi instance on the other board as master. Master sends a piece of data to
        slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the
        data received from master is correct. And slave will print what it received.'
