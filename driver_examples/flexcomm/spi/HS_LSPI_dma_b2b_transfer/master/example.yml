      brief: 'The spi_HS_LSPI_dma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use driver
        API to transfer in DMA way.  In this example, one spi instance as master and
        another spi instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a piece of
        data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checksif
        the data received from slave is correct. This example needs to work with spi_dma_b2b_transfer_slave
        example.Note: This example will run in master mode, please prepare another
        board for slave, and the slave       board should be started first.Project
        Infomation1.How to set the baudrate of SPI?  The baudrate of SPI is easy to
        set, just make sure the source clock of SPI.'
