      brief: The spi_HS_LSPI_dma_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use driver
        API to transfer in DMA way.  In this example, one spi instance as master and
        another spi instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a piece of
        data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checksif
        the data received from master is correct. This example needs to work with
        spi_HS_LSPI_dma_b2b_transfer_master example.
