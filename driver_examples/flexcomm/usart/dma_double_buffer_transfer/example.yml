      brief: 'This example shows how to use the DMA driver to implement a double buffer
        receive scheme from the USARTThe example shows the double buffer constructed
        using two descriptors (g_pingpong_desc). These descriptors are cycled from
        one to the other.Things to note- The descriptors of the ping pong transfer
        need to be aligned to size 16- The inital transfer will perform the same job
        as first descriptor of ping pong, so the first linkeage is to go to g_pingpong_desc[1]-
        g_pingpong_desc[1] then chains the g_pingpong_desc[0] as the next descriptor-
        The properties are set up such that g_pingpong_desc[0] (and the initial configuration
        uses INTA to signal back to the callback)- g_pingpong_desc[1] uses INTB to
        signal to the callback- The scheduled callback uses this information to know
        which data was last writtenA note on PerformanceThe intent of this example
        is to illustrate how a double-buffer scheme can be implemented using the dma.
        The performance of this example will be limited to how quickly the echo printer
        can read-out the data from the ping pong buffer and display it. This means
        that the example will work well if characters are entered at a rate where
        the DMA callback to echo the string can keep up with the input stream. Connecting
        the USARTRX to a continuous fast speed will cause the DMA to fall behind. '
