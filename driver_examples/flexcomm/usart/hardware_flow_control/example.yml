      brief: The usart_hardware_flow_control example project demonstrates the usage
        of the hardware flow control function. This example sends data to itself(loopback),
        and hardware flow control is enabled in the example. The CTS(clear-to-send)
        pin is for transmiter to check if receiver is ready, if the CTS pin is asserted,
        transmiter starts to send data. The RTS(request-to-send) pin is for receiver
        to inform the transmiter if receiver is ready to receive data. So, please
        connect RTS to CTS pin directly.
