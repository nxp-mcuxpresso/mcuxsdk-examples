# usart_sync_transfer_master

## Overview
The uart synchronous transfer master example shows how to use usart driver in synchronous way:

In this example, one USART is configured as master node and another is configured as slave node.
Master will send data to slave firstly, and then receive data from slave, slave board will send back
the received data.
