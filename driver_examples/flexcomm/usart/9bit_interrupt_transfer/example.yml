      brief: The usart_9bit_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use usart driver
        in 9-bit mode in multi-slave system. Master can send data to slave with certain
        address specifically, and slave can only receive data when it is addressed.
        In this example, one usart instance is used with address configured. Its TX
        and RX pins are connected together. First it sends a piece of data out, then
        addresses itself, after that sends the other piece of data. Only data sent
        after the address can be received by itself.
