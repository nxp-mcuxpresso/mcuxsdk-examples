      brief: The usart_dma_low_power example shows how to use usart to wake up the
        system in low power modes, and how to wake up for DMA only. In this example,
        one usart instance connects to PC through usart, the board will start receiving
        characters from PC and then go into low power mode. Each character from PC
        will only wake up the DMA but the CPU keeps in low power mode. Once 8 characters
        were received, system will be woken up and echo the characters to PC.
