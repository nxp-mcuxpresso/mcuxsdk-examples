      brief: The I2S example project uses one I2S interface to continuously record
        input sound to a buffer and another I2S interface to playback the buffer to
        output - digital loopback. It requires NXP Mic/Audio/Oled Shield with TFA9896
        codec. It needs to have 1-2 connected on JP3.
