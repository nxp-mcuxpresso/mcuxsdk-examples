      brief: The i3c_interrupt_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use i3c driver
        as master to do board to board transfer using interrupt method. In this example,
        one i3c instance as master and another i3c instance on the other board as
        slave. Master will assign dynamic address to slave, then sends a piece of
        data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks
        if the data received from slave is correct.
