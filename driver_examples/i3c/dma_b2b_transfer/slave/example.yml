      brief: The i3c_dma_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use i3c driver as
        slave to do board to board transfer with a dma master. In this example, one
        i3c instance as slave and another i3c instance on the other board as master.
        Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave.
        This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
