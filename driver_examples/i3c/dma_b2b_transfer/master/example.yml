      brief: The i3c_dma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use i3c driver as
        master to do board to board transfer using dma method. In this example, one
        i3c instance as master and another i3c instance on the other board as slave.
        Master will assign dynamic address to slave, then sends a piece of data to
        slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the
        data received from slave is correct.
