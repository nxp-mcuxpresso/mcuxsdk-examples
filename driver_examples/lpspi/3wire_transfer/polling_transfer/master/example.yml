      brief: The lpspi_3wire_polling_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI's 3-wire
        mode in polling way:In this example , we need two boards, one board used as
        LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.The file 'lpspi_3wire_polling_transfer_master.c'
        includes the LPSPI master code.1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from
        LPSPI slave in polling . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the
        data)2. LPSPI master will use SOUT pin as input/output pin, and slave will
        use SIN pin as input/output pin.
