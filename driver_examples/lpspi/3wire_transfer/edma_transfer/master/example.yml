      brief: The lpspi_3wire_edma_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI's 3-wire
        mode in edma way:In this example , we need two boards, one board used as LPSPI
        master and another board used as LPSPI slave.The file 'lpspi_3wire_edma_transfer_master.c'
        includes the LPSPI master code.1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from
        LPSPI slave in edma . (LPSPI Slave using edma to receive/send the data)2.
        LPSPI master will use SOUT pin as input/output pin, and slave will use SIN
        pin as input/output pin.
