# lpspi_qspi_flash

## Overview
This example shows how to use LPSPI to control the QSPI flash, such as erasing,
programing, reading.  To simplify the code, this example uses GPIO to control
the PCS, but not use LPSPI to control it.

When the project run finished, you can see the pass or fail information from
the terminal.
