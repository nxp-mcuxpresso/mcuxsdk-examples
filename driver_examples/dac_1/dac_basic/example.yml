      brief: The dac_basic example shows how to use DAC module simply as the general
        DAC converter.When the DAC's buffer feature is not enabled, the first item
        of the buffer is used as the DAC output data register.The converter would
        always output the value of the first item. In this example, it gets the value
        from terminal,outputs the DAC output voltage through DAC output pin.
