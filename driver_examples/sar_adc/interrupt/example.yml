      brief: The SAR ADC interrupt example shows the simplest way to use the SAR ADC
        driver. In this example, three channels (channels 0, 1, and 2) are used to
        form a conversion chain, these three channels are executed in the normal conversion
        scan mode. The end-of-channel interrupt, pre-sample, DMA transfer and watchdog
        features of each channel in the conversion chain are disabled, and the end-of-chain
        interrupt is enabled. The user should provide a voltage signal as input to
        each conversion channel. Running the project, When all channel conversions
        in the chain are completed, the end-of-chain interrupt will be triggered.
        If the result of channel conversion is valid, it will be printed to the debug
        console.
