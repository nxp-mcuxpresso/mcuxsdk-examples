      brief: The SAR ADC self-test example shows the simplest way to use the SAR ADC
        driver. In this example, three channels (channels 0, 1, and 2) are used to
        form a conversion chain, these three channels are executed in the normal conversion
        scan mode. The end-of-channel interrupt, pre-sample, DMA transfer, and watchdog
        features of each channel in the conversion chain are disabled. The self-test
        function is enabled, and the self-test watchdog threshold is used to check
        whether the self-test channel converted data is out of the range specified
        in the threshold, the watchdog timer is an additional check that monitors
        the sequence of the self-test algorithm implemented. It also verifies that
        the algorithm is completed within a safe time period. The user should provide
        a voltage signal to each conversion channel. When running the project, when
        algorithm S step0, step1, step2, algorithm C, and watchdog timer errors occur,
        the corresponding error information will be printed to the debug console.
