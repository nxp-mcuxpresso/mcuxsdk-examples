      brief: The SAR ADC watchdog example shows the simplest way to use the SAR ADC
        driver. In this example, channel 0 is used to execute in the normal conversion
        scan mode. The end-of-conversion, pre-sample, and DMA transfer features of
        each channel in the conversion chain are disabled. The analog watchdog function
        is enabled to monitor the conversion result, and the low and high threshold
        interrupt is enabled, The user should provide a voltage signal to each conversion
        channel. Running the project, after the channel conversion is completed, the
        conversion data will be compared with the low and high threshold values. If
        the conversion data is lower than the low threshold value, the low threshold
        interrupt will be asserted, if the conversion data is higher than the high
        threshold value, the high threshold interrupt will be asserted, and if the
        conversion data is valid, the conversion data will be printed on the debug
        console.
