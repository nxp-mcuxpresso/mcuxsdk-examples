      brief: The SAR ADC polling example shows the simplest way to use the SAR ADC
        driver. In this example, three channels (channel 0, 1, and 2) are used to
        form a conversion chain, these three channels are executed in the normal conversion
        one-shot mode. The end-of-channel interrupt, pre-sample, DMA transfer, and
        watchdog features of each channel in the conversion chain are disabled. The
        user should provide a voltage signal to each conversion channel. When running
        the project, type any key into the debug console to start the conversion.
        After the conversion is completed, the ADC will enter the IDLE state. Then
        poll to access the result register of the corresponding channel, if the result
        of the channel conversion is valid, it will be printed to the debug console.
