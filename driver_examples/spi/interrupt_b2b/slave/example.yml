      brief: The spi_interrupt_b2b_slave example shows how to use spi functional API
        to do interrupt transfer as a slave:In this example, the spi instance as slave.
        Slave receives data froma master and send a peiece of data to master,and check
        if the data slave received is correct. This example needs to work with spi_interrupt_b2b_master
        example.
