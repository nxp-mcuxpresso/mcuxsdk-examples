# spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer_master

## Overview
The spi_interrupt_board2board_master example shows how to use spi driver as master to do board to board transfer with
interrupt:

In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance on othereboard as slave. Master sends a piece of
data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
