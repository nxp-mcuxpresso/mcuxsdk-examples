# spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer_slave

## Overview
The spi_interrupt_board2board_slave example shows how to use spi driver as slave to do board to board transfer with 
interrupt:

In this example, one spi instance as slave and another spi instance on other board as master. Master sends a piece of
data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from master is correct.
