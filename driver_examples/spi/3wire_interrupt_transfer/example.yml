      brief: The spi_3wire_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use spi driver
        in 3-wire mode:In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi
        instance as slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave,and check if the
        data slave received is correct. Actually, spi 3-wire mode can also support
        DMA transfer.
