# spi_3wire_interrupt_transfer

## Overview
The spi_3wire_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use spi driver in 3-wire mode:

In this example, one spi instance as master and another spi instance as slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave,
and check if the data slave received is correct. Actually, spi 3-wire mode can also support DMA transfer.
