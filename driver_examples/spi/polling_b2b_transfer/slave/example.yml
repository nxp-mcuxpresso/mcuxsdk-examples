      brief: 'The spi_polling_board2board_slave example shows how to use spi driver
        as slave to do board to board transfer withpolling:Notice: The SPI slave of
        this example uses interrupt mode, as there is no polling mode for SPI slave.In
        this example, one spi instance as slave and another spi instance on other
        board as master. Master sends a piece ofdata to slave, and receive a piece
        of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from master is
        correct.'
