      brief: The i2c_polling_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use i2c driver
        as master to do board to board transfer using polling method:In this example,
        one i2c instance as master and another i2c instance on the other board as
        slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data
        from slave. This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
