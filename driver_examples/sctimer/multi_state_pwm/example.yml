      brief: The SCTImer multi-state project is a demonstration program of the SCTimer
        state machine. It shows how to set up events to be triggered in a certain
        stateand transitioning between states.State 0 has 2 events that generate a
        PWM signal, it also has an event linked to an input signal to transition to
        State 1.State 1 has 4 events that generate 2 PWM signals, it also has an event
        linked to an input signal to transition to State 0.
