      brief: The LPCMP polling Example shows the simplest way to use LPCMP driver
        and help user with a quick start.In this example, user should indicate an
        input channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the
        LPCMP's positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal DAC is
        used to generate the fixed voltage abouthalf value of reference voltage.When
        running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then
        the comparator's output would changebetween logic one and zero when the user's
        voltage crosses the internal DAC's value. The endless loop in main() functionwould
        detect the logic value of comparator's output, and change the LED. The LED
        would be turned on when the compareoutput is logic one, or turned off when
        zero.
