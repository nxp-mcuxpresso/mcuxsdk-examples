      brief: The LPCMP interrupt Example shows how to use interrupt with LPCMP driver.In
        this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal
        (can be controlled by user) as the LPCMP's positive channel input. On the
        negative side, the internal DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage abouthalf
        value of reference voltage.When running the project, change the input voltage
        of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would changebetween
        logic one and zero when the user-defined channel's voltage crosses the internal
        DAC's value. The change ofcomparator's output would generate the falling and
        rising edge events with their interrupts enabled. When any LPCMP interrupt
        happens, the LPCMP's ISR would turn on the LED light if detecting the output's
        rising edge, or turn off it whendetecting the output's falling edge.
