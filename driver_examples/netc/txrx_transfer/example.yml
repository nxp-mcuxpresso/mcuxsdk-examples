      brief: 'The example shows the way to use NETC driver to receive and transmit
        frame in the 1588 feature required cases.1. This example shows how to initialize
        the NETC. 2. How to get the time stamp of the PTP 1588 timer. 3. How to use
        Get the ENET_QOS transmit and receive frame time stamp.The example transmits
        20 number PTP event frame, shows the timestamp of the transmitted frame.The
        length, source MAC address and destination MAC address of the received frame
        will be print. The time stamp of the received timestamp will be print when
        the PTP message frame is received(the outside loopback cable can be used to
        see the right rx time-stamping log since we send the ptp message). '
