      brief: The COP Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK cop driver.In
        this example, after 10 times of refreshing, a timeout reset is generated.Please
        notice that because COP control registers are write-once only, so the COP_Init
        function and the COP_Disable function can be called only once after reset.In
        SystemInit() function which is called in startup code, there is an operation
        to disable the watchdog if macro DISABLE_WDOG is defined as 0, and by default
        if the DISABLE_WDOG is not defined, the DISABLE_WDOG is defined as 1. So this
        example has a special project setting that defines the DISABLE_WDOG macro
        to 0 so the startup code will skip the disable COP WDOG operation.
