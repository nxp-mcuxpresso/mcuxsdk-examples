      brief: The CMP interrupt Example shows how to use interrupt with CMP driver.In
        this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal
        (can be controlled by user) as the CMP's positive channel input. On the negative
        side, the internal 12-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage about
        half value of reference voltage.When running the project, change the input
        voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would change
        between logic one and zero when the user-defined channel's voltage crosses
        the internal DAC's value. The change of comparator's output would generate
        the falling and rising edge events with their interrupts enabled. When any
        CMP interrupt happens, the CMP's ISR would turn on the LED light if detecting
        the output's rising edge, or turn off it when detecting the output's falling
        edge.
