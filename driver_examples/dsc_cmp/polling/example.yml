      brief: The CMP polling Example shows the simplest way to use CMP driver and
        help user with a quick start.In this example, user should indicate an input
        channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the CMP's
        positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal 12-bit DAC is used
        to generate the fixed voltage about half value of reference voltage.When running
        the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's
        output would change between logic one and zero when the user's voltage crosses
        the internal DAC's value. The endless loop in main() function would detect
        the logic value of comparator's output, and change the LED. The LED would
        be turned on when the compare output is logic one, or turned off when zero.
