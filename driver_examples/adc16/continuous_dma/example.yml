      brief: 'The ADC16 continuous DMA demo application demonstrates the usage of
        the ADC and DMA peripheral while in a continuous mode. TheADC16 is first set
        to continuous mode. In continuous convert configuration, only the initial
        rising-edge to launch continuous conversions isobserved, and until conversion
        is aborted, the ADC16 continues to do conversions on the same SCn register
        that initiated the conversion. DMA request will be asserted during an ADC16
        conversion complete event noted when any of the SC1n[COCO] flags is asserted.
        DMA will transferADC16 results to memory and if users press any key, demo
        will average ADC16 results stored in memory and print average on the terminal.  '
