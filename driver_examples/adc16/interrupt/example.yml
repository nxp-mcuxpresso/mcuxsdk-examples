      brief: The adc16_interrupt example shows how to use interrupt with ADC16 driver.In
        this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can
        be controlled by user) as the ADC16'ssample input. When running the project,
        typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. ADC interrupt
        would be asserted once the conversion is completed. In ADC ISR, the conversion
        completed flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also,
        the conversion result value is stored, and the ISR counter is increased. These
        information would be printed when the execution return to the main loop.The
        point is that the ADC16 interrupt configuration is set when configuring the
        ADC16's conversion channel. When in software trigger mode, the conversion
        would be launched by the operation of configuring channel, just like writing
        aconversion command. So if user wants to generate the interrupt every time
        the conversion is completed, the channel's configuration with enabling interrupt
        setting would be used for each conversion.
