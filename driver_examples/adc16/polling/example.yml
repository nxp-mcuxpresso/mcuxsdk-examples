      brief: The adc16_polling example shows the simplest way to use ADC16 driver.In
        this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can
        be controlled by user) as the ADC16'ssample input. When running the project,
        typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution
        would check the conversion completed flag in loop until the flag is asserted,
        which means the conversion is completed. Then read the conversion result value
        and print it to debug console.Note, the default setting of initialization
        for the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can changethe
        configuration structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.The
        auto-calibration is not essential but strongly recommended. It can help to
        adjust the converter itself and improvethe ADC16's performance.
