      brief: The lpi2c_edma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use lpi2c driver
        as master to do board to board transfer with EDMA:In this example, one lpi2c
        instance as master and another lpi2c instance on the other board as slave.
        Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave.
        This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
