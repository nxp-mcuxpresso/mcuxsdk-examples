# lpi2c_polling_transfer

## Overview
The LPI2C Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate
the Low Power Inter-Integrated Circuit.
The example uses one lpi2c instance as the master to send data to another lpi2c
instance as the slave.
The slave will check the data it receives and shows the log.
