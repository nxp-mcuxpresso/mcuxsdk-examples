      brief: 'The CADC continuous EDMA demo application demonstrates the usage of
        the ADC and EDMA peripheral while in a Loop Sequential mode. TheCADC is first
        set to Loop Sequential mode. In Loop Sequential convert configuration, only
        the initial rising-edge to launch continuous conversions isobserved, and until
        conversion is aborted, the CADC continues to do conversions on the same CLIST
        register that initiated the conversion. EDMA request will be asserted during
        an CADC conversion READY event noted when any of the ADC_RDY[RDYn] flags is
        asserted. EDMA will transferCADC results to memory and if users press any
        key, demo will average CADC results stored in memory and print average on
        the terminal.  '
