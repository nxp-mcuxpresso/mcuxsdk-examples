# cadc_expansion_mux_aux_opamp

## Overview

The CADC expansion mux aux OPAMP application demonstrates how to use an expansion 
of the ADC to implement voltage acquisition and change the gain of an operational 
amplifier. The OPAMP configuration has 4 different gains, namely X1, X2, X4, X8. 
Enter any key in the terminal to trigger ADC conversion to sample the OPAMP output, 
and switch the OPAMP gain at the same time. ADC Converter A and OPAMPA are used in 
pairs.
