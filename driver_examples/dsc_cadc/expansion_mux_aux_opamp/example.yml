      brief: The CADC expansion mux aux OPAMP application demonstrates how to use
        an expansion of the ADC to implement voltage acquisition and change the gain
        of an operational amplifier. The OPAMP configuration has 4 different gains,
        namely X1, X2, X4, X8. Enter any key in the terminal to trigger ADC conversion
        to sample the OPAMP output, and switch the OPAMP gain at the same time. ADC
        Converter A and OPAMPA are used in pairs.
