      brief: The cadc_parallel_independent_conversion example shows how to use each
        converter separately with CADC driver.In this example, the CADC is configured
        as "kCADC_ScanModeTriggeredParallelSimultaneous" work mode. User should indicate4
        channel pairs to provide the differential voltage signal (can be controlled
        by user) as the inputs for CADC sample slots. These sample slots would be
        assembled into the two short conversion sequences (can include 8 sample slots
        as most). Also the "simultaneous mode" is disabled, so that each converter
        can be operated by their own control logic separately.When running the project,
        typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. And then,
        the conversion result data of the converter A's sample slots (Sample 0, 1)
        would be displayed in the terminal. Type the keyboard againto trigger the
        converter B, the conversion result data of the converter B's two sample slots
        (Sample 8, 9) would be displayed.
