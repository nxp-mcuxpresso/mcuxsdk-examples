      brief: 'The CADC continuous DMA demo application demonstrates the usage of the
        ADC and DMA peripheral while in a Loop Sequential mode. TheCADC is first set
        to Loop Sequential mode. In Loop Sequential convert configuration, only the
        initial rising-edge to launch continuous conversions isobserved, and until
        conversion is aborted, the CADC continues to do conversions on the same CLIST
        register that initiated the conversion. DMA request will be asserted during
        an CADC conversion READY event noted when any of the ADC_RDY[RDYn] flags is
        asserted. DMA will transfer CADC results to memory and if users press any
        key, demo will average CADC results stored in memory and print average on
        the terminal. '
