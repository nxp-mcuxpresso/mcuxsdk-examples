      brief: 'The cadc_sequential_conversion example shows how to use a long conversion
        sequence (can include as many as all the 16 sample slots) with CADC driver.In
        this example, the CADC is configured as "kCADC_DualConverterWorkAsTriggeredSequential"
        work mode. User should indicate 4 channel pairs to provide the differential
        voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the inputs for CADCsample slots.
        These sample slots would be assembled into a long conversion sequence.In "kCADC_DualConverterWorkAsTriggeredSequential"
        mode, all the sample slots are organized as a long conversion sequence. The
        converter A''s control logic would be used to operate this long conversion
        sequence. It can start and stopthe sequence.When running the project, typing
        any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. And then, the conversion
        result data of the four sample slots (Sample 0, 1, 2, 3) would be displayed
        in the terminal. '
