      brief: 'The PIT TRIGGER EDMA conversion demo application demonstrates how to
        use PIT to trigger CADC conversion and configure xbara to connect PIT output
        with CADC input. CADC performs data conversion after each count period of
        PIT. The EDMA request will be set during any CADC conversion ready event recorded
        when the ADC_STAT[EOSI0] flag is set. EDMA will transfer CADC results into
        memory. Enter any key via terminal will start PIT to trigger CADC periodly,
        and then the average value(16 times) of thermistor will be printed on terminal.  '
