      brief: 'The usart_interrupt_sync_transfer example shows how to use usart API
        in synchronous mode:In this example, one usart instance will be selected as
        master ,and another as slave. The master will send data to slave in polling
        way, and slave will receive data in nonblocking way.After all data has been
        received by slave, info will be printed by debug console. '
