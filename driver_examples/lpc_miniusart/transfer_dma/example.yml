      brief: 'This example shows how to use the DMA driver to implement a double buffer
        receive scheme from the USART The example shows the double buffer constructed
        using two descriptors (g_pingpong_desc). These descriptors are cycled from
        one to the other.Things to note- The descriptors of the ping pong transfer
        need to be aligned to size 16- The initial transfer will perform the same
        job as first descriptor of ping pong, so the first linkeage   is to go to
        g_pingpong_desc[1]- g_pingpong_desc[1] then chains the g_pingpong_desc[0]
        as the next descriptor- The properties are set up such that g_pingpong_desc[0]
        (and the initial configuration uses INTA to signal  back to the callback)-
        g_pingpong_desc[1] uses INTB to signal to the callback- The scheduled callback
        uses this information to know which data was last writtenA note on Performance
        The intent of this example is to illustrate how a double-buffer scheme can
        be implemented using the dma. The performance of this example will be limited
        to how quickly the echo printer can read-out the data from the ping pong buffer
        and display it. This means that the example will work well if characters are
        entered at a rate where the DMA callback to echo the string can keep up with
        the input stream. Connecting the USARTRX to a continuous fast speed will cause
        the DMA to fall behind.  '
