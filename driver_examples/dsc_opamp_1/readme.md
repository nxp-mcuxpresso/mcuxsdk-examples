# opamp_basic

## Overview

This project shows how to use the OPAMP driver. In this example, the OPAMP works in the internal gain mode,
the positive terminal of the OPAMP is connected to the external input source, and the OPAMP output comes from 2X of the external input voltage.
When the input voltage changes, the OPAMP output changes accordingly.
