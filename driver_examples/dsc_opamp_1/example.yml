      brief: This project shows how to use the OPAMP driver. In this example, the
        OPAMP works in the internal gain mode, the positive terminal of the OPAMP
        is connected to the external input source, and the OPAMP output comes from
        2X of the external input voltage. When the input voltage changes, the OPAMP
        output changes accordingly.
