      brief: The pit_scout project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK PIT
        driver for synchronous output. It sets up the PIT hardware block to  a periodic
        rate of 1 second. Synchronous output when PIT counter equals the modolus value.
        Synchronous output is set to toggle mode. After reset, SYNC_OUT is low-level,
        when PIT counter equals MODULO value firstly, SYNC_OUT toggles to high-level
        and keep high-level until PIT counter equal MODULO value next time, SYNC_OUT
        toggles to low-level. Use the Oscilloscope to measure the signal of XBARA_OUT10,
        the sync_out waveform will be outputted.
