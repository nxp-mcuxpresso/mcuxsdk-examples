      brief: The lpi2c_edma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use lpi2c driver
        as master to do board to board transfer with a EDMA master:In this example,
        one lpi2c instance as master and another lpi2c instance on the other board
        as slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data
        from slave. This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
