      brief: The lpi2c_interrupt_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use lpi2c
        driver as slave to do board to board transfer with interrupt:In this example,
        one lpi2c instance as slave and another lpi2c instance on the other board
        as master. Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data
        from slave.
