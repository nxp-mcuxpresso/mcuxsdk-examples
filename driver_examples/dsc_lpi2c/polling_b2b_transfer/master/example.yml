      brief: The lpi2c_polling_b2b_master example shows how to use lpi2c driver as
        master to do board to board transfer using polling method:In this example,
        one lpi2c instance as master and another lpi2c instance on the other board
        as slave. Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data
        from slave. This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
