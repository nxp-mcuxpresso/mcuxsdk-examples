      brief: The adc_polling example shows the simplest way to use adc driver.In this
        example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be
        controlled by user) as the adc'ssample input. When running the project, typing
        any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. The execution would
        check the conversion completed flag in loop until the flag is asserted, which
        means the conversion is completed. Then read the conversion result value and
        print it to debug console.Note, the default setting of initialization for
        the ADC converter is just an available configuration. User can changethe configuration
        structure's setting in application to fit the special requirement.The auto-calibration
        is not essential but strongly recommended. It can help to adjust the converter
        itself and improvethe adc's performance.
