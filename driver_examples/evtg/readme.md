# evtg

## Overview
The EVTG demo application demonstrates the use of IO and EVTG peripherals.
The example Use the two IO as the input of the EVTG function: EVTG_OUT = (IO0 & IO1).
When IO0 and IO1 are both high level, the EVTG_OUT is high level.
When any of IO is low level, the EVTG_OUT is low level.
The purpose of this demonstration is to show how to use the EVTG driver in the SDK software.
