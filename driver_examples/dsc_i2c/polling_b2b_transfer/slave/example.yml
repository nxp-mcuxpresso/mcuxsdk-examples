      brief: The i2c_polling_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use i2c driver
        as slave to do board to board transfer with a polling master:In this example,
        one i2c instance as slave and another i2c instance on the other board as master.
        Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave.
        This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
