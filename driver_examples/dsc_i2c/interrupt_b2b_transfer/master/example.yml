      brief: The i2c_interrupt_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use i2c driver
        as master to do board to board transfer with interrupt:In this example, one
        i2c instance as master and another i2c instance on the other board as slave.
        Master sends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave.
        This example checks if the data received from slave is correct.
