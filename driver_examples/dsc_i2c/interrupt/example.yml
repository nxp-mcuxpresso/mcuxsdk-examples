      brief: The i2c_functional_interrupt example shows how to use I2C functional
        driver to build a interrupt based application:In this example , one i2c instance
        used as I2C master and another i2c instance used as I2C slave .1. I2C master
        send data to I2C slave in interrupt . (I2C Slave using interrupt to receive
        the data)2. I2C master read data from I2C slave in interrupt . (I2C Slave
        using interrupt to send the data)3. The example assumes that the connection
        is OK between master and slave, so there's NO error handling code.
