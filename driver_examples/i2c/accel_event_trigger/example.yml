      brief: This example demonstrate how to wake up main device in low power mode
        with accelerometer trigger event. The accelerometer can keep working while
        the main device is in low power mode (or deep sleep mode). Only when the configured
        event was captured, the accelerometer will trigger the interrupt to wake up
        the main device. This example uses I2C to configure the accelerometer to work
        in 800Hz data rate with low noise mode. And when the tap event is triggered,
        it will wake up the main device. And 32 samples around the trigger event will
        be captured.
