# spi_polling_b2b_transfer_slave

## Overview
The spi_polling_board2board_slave example shows how to use spi driver as slave to do board to board transfer with
polling:

Notice: The SPI slave of this example uses interrupt mode, as there is no polling mode for SPI slave.

In this example, one spi instance as slave and another spi instance on other board as master. Master sends a piece of
data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from master is correct.
