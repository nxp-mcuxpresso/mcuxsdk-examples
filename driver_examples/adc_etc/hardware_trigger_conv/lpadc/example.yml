      brief: The adc_etc_software_trigger_conv example shows how to use the ADC_ETC
        to generate a ADC trigger by PIT channel0 trigger.Every 1 second, PIT channel0
        would send a trigger signal to ADC_ETC, which can arbitrate and manage multiple
        external triggers,and ADC_ETC would generate ADC trigger.In this example,
        the ADC is configured with hardware trigger. Once ADC gets the trigger from
        the ADC_ETC, the conversion goes,then the ADC_ETC ISR would be executed.
