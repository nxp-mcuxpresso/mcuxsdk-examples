      brief: The OPAMP DAC ADC example shows how to use OPAMP PGA mode. in this example,
        both positive input and negative input should be connected to GND,the positive
        reference voltage is set as DAC output, the OPAMP output is 1X of DAC output.
        When DAC output changes, the OPAMP changes accordingly. In PGA mode, the OPAMP
        output pin does not support direct measurement. Only the ADC is supported
        to sample the OPAMP output voltage, and the output range of the OPAMP positive
        reference voltage is 0 to VDDA-0.8V.
