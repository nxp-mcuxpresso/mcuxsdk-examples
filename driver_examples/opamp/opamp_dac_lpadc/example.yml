      brief: The OPAMP DAC LPADC example demonstrates how to use the OPAMP driver.
        In this example, the OUTSW, BUFFEN, ADCSW1, and ADCSW2 are enabled, and the
        user can use the ADC to measure the OPAMPx_INT voltage and the OPAMPx_OBS
        voltage. The user needs to connect the OPAMP positive input port and negative
        input port to GND. The positive (OPAMPx_INP0) reference voltage is set to
        the DAC output, the user selects the OPAMP negative gain by using the PC keyboard,
        and the positive gain is fixed to 1x, So, the OPAMP output voltage is equal
        to ((1 + Ngain) / 2)Vpref.
