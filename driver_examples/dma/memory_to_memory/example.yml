      brief: The DMA memory to memory example is a simple demonstration program that
        uses the SDK software.It executes one shot transfer from source buffer to
        destination buffer using the SDK DMA drivers.The purpose of this example is
        to show how to use the DMA and to provide a simple example for debugging and
        further development.
