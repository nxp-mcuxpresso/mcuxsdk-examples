      brief: 'The dspi_half_duplex_edma_transfer_slave example shows how to receive
        and transmit data to master board.Notice: The SPI slave of this example uses
        edma mode. The data transfer size(not buffer size) is twice ofthe master''s
        transfer size. The first half of the transmission will receive data, and the
        second half will senddata back to master, so the begain address of the receive
        buffer is &rxDataPolling[64].In this example, one spi instance as slave and
        another spi instance on the other board as master. Master sends a piece of
        data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks
        if the data received from master is correct. And slave will print what it
        received.'
