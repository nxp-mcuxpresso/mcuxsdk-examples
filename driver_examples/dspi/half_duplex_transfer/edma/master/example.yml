      brief: 'The dspi_half_duplex_edma_transfer_master example shows how to use driver
        API to transfer in half-duplex way.  In this example, one spi instance as
        master and another spi instance on the other board as slave. Master sendsa
        piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example
        checks if the data received fromslave is correct.Besides, master will transfer
        in EDMA way. '
