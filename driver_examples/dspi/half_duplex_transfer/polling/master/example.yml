      brief: 'The dspi_half_duplex_polling_transfer_master example shows how to use
        driver API to transfer in half-duplex way.  In this example, one spi instance
        as master and another spi instance on the other board as slave. Master sends
        apiece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example
        checks if the data received from slave is correct. Besides, master will transfer
        in polling way. '
