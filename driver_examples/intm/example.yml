      brief: The INTM project is a simple demonstration of the SDK INTM driver. The
        role of INTM is to monitor the interrupt response. The main monitoring is
        whether the interrupt has timed out from the request to the response. Up to
        4 interrupts can be monitored simultaneously. This example is to detect the
        key interrupt, verify the function of INTM by delaying the time from the trigger
        to the response of the key interrupt, and confirm the interrupt timeout by
        the flag bit one.
