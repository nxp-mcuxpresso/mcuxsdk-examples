      brief: The TPM project is a demonstration program of generating a combined PWM
        signal by the SDK TPM driver. It sets up the TPMhardware block to output PWM
        signals on two TPM channels. The example also show's the complementary mode
        of operationand deadtime insertion.On boards that have 2 LEDs connected to
        the TPM pins, the user will seea change in LED brightness if user enter different
        values.And if the board do not support LEDs to show, the outputs can be observed
        by oscilloscope.
