      brief: The dac_dma example shows how to use DAC with dma and produce an arbitrary,
        user-defined waveform ofselectable frequency.The output can be observed with
        an oscilloscope. When the DAC's double-buffer feature is enabled, any write
        to the CR register will only load the pre-buffer, whichshares its register
        address with the CR register. The CR itself will be loaded from the pre-buffer
        whenever the counter reaches zero and the DMA request would be raised. At
        the same time the counter is reloaded with the COUNTVALregister value. user-defined
        waveform array would be transfered to pre-buffer in order by DMA.
