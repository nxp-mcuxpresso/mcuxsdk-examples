      brief: The dac_interrupt example shows how to use DAC with interrupts and produce
        an arbitrary, user-defined waveform ofselectable frequency.The output can
        be observed with an oscilloscope. When the DAC's double-buffer feature is
        enabled, any write to the CR register will only load the pre-buffer, whichshares
        its register address with the CR register. The CR itself will be loaded from
        the pre-buffer whenever the counter reaches zero and the interrupt would occur.
        At the same time the counter is reloaded with the COUNTVALregister value.
        In the DAC ISR, user-defined waveform array would be transfered to pre-buffer
        in order.
