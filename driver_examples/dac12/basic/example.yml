      brief: The dac12_basic example shows how to use DAC12 module simply as the general
        DAC12 converter.When the DAC12's fifo feature is not enabled, Any write to
        the DATA register will replace thedata in the buffer and push data to analog
        conversion without trigger support.In this example, it gets the value from
        terminal,outputs the DAC12 output voltage through DAC12 output pin.
