      brief: The dac12_fifo_interrupt example shows how to use DAC12 FIFO interrupt.When
        the DAC12 FIFO watermark interrupt is enabled firstly, the application would
        enter the DAC12 ISR immediately, since remaining FIFO data is less than the
        watermark. Then the FIFO would be feed inside the ISR. Then the DAC12 interrupt
        could be restrained. Once the DAC12 FIFO is triggered in while loop, the data
        in FIFO is read out, then it becomes less than the watermark, so the FIFO
        would be feed again in DAC12 ISR. With this example, user can define the DAC12
        output array to generate the different wave output. Also the software trigger
        can be called in some timer ISR so that the DAC12 would output the analog
        signal in indicated period. Or even use the hardware trigger to release the
        CPU.
