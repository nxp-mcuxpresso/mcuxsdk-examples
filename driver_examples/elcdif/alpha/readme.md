# elcdif_alpha

## Overview
The ELCDIF ALPHA project shows how to drive the use the eLCDIF alpha surface.
Int this example, there are two surfaces, the back ground surface is a blue
rectangle in the center of the frame, the overlay surface is full screen red.
If this example runs correctly, you can see two rectangles(a smaller blue rectangle
in the screen center, and a larger red rectangle), the alpha value of the two
rectangles change.
