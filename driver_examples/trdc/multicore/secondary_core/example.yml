      brief: The Multicore TRDC demo application demonstrates how to use TRDC on a
        multicore system to control the access policy of the memory block checker(MBC)
        and memory region checker(MRC), and how to configure the domain access control(DAC)
        for bus masters to access both secure and non-secure domains. First, the primary
        core example uses 1 domain for secure access demo. The primary core which
        is secure first sets a MRC memory region and a MBC memory block to non-secure
        access only, then trys to access the memory which triggers the hardfault.
        In hardfault the access control is changed to secure access to resolve the
        error. Then, the primary core releases the secondary core from the reset.
        The secondary core example uses 2 domains, one is for secure access and the
        other is for non-secure access. By enabling different DAC configuration, different
        domain is used for the access control. The secure access process is the same
        as the primary core. In the non-secure access demo, the secondary core sets
        a MRC memory region and a MBC memory block to secure access only, and switch
        to the non-secure DAC configuration which force the core to be non-secure.
        Then trys to access the memory which triggers the hardfault. In hardfault
        certain flags stored in flash is set to let primary core know and update the
        configuration to non-secure access to resolve the error, because the TRDC
        is secure access only.
