      brief: The dac_buffer_interrupt example shows how to use DAC buffer with interrupts.When
        the DAC's buffer feature is enabled, user can benefit from the automation
        of updating DAC output by hardware/software trigger. As we know, the DAC converter
        outputs the value of item pointed by current read pointer. Once the buffer
        is triggered by software or hardware, the buffer's read pointer would move
        automatically as the work mode is set,like normal (cycle) mode, swing mode,
        one-time-scan mode or FIFO mode.In this example, it captures the user's type-in
        operation from terminal and does the software trigger to the buffer.The terminal
        would also display the log that shows the current buffer pointer's position
        with buffer events.
