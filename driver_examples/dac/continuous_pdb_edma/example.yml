      brief: The demo shows how to use the PDB to generate a DAC trigger and use the
        DMA to transfer data into DAC buffer.In this example, DAC is first set to
        normal buffer mode. PDB is as DAC hardware trigger source and DMA would work
        when DAC read pointer is zero. When run the example, the DAC is triggered
        by PDB and the read pointer increases by one,every time the trigger occurs.
        When the read pointer reaches the upper limit, it goes to zero directly in
        the next trigger event.while read pointer goes to zero, DMA request will be
        triggered and transfer data into DAC buffer. The user should probethe DAC
        output with a oscilloscope to see the Half-sine signal.
