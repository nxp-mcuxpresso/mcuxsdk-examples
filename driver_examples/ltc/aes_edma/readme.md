# ltc_aes_edma

## Overview
This project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software for encryption/decryption sample data using EDMA for
AES-CBC algorithm.

## Running the demo
When the demo runs successfully, from the terminal you can see:

................ LTC (AES EDMA)  DRIVER  EXAMPLE .............................

Testing input string:
          Once upon a midnight dreary,
           while I pondered weak and weary,
          Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
          While I nodded,
           nearly napping,
           suddenly there came a tapping,
          As of some one gently rapping,
           rapping at my chamber doorIts some visitor,
           I muttered,
           tapping at my chamber doorOnly this,
           and nothing more.
