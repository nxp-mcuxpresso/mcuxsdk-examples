# ltc_des_edma

## Overview
This project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software for encryption/decryption some data using EDMA for 
DES-cbc and DES3-cbc algorithm.

## Running the demo
When the demo runs successfully, from the terminal you can see:

Testing input string:
          Once upon a midnight dreary,
           while I pondered weak and weary,
          Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
          While I nodded,
           nearly napping,
           suddenly there came a tapping,
          As of some one gently rapping,
           rapping at my chamber doorIts some visitor,
           I muttered,
           tapping at my chamber doorOnly this,
           and nothing more.
