      brief: The FTM project is a demonstration program of generating a combined PWM
        signal by the SDK FTM driver. It sets up the FTMhardware block to output PWM
        signals on two TPM channels. The example also shows the complementary mode
        of operationand deadtime insertion.On boards that have 2 LEDs connected to
        the FTM pins, the user will see a change in LED brightness.And if the board
        do not support LEDs to show, the outputs can be observed by oscilloscope.
