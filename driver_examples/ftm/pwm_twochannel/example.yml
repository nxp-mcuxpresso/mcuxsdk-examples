      brief: The FTM pwm two channel Example project is a demonstration program that
        uses the KSDK software to generate a square pulse PWM on 2 channel to control
        the LED brightness.- FTM generates a PWM with the increasing and decreasing
        duty cycle.- LED brightness is increasing and then dimming. This is a continuous
        process.
