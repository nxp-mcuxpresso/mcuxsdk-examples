# ftm_pwm_twochannel

## Overview
The FTM pwm two channel Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to generate a square 
pulse PWM(24kHZ) on 2 channel to control the LED brightness. It sets up the FTM hardware block to output two edge-aligned PWM signals.
The PWM dutycycles are periodically updated.
- FTM generates a PWM with the increasing and decreasing duty cycle.
- LED brightness is increasing and then dimming. This is a continuous process.
The user should probe the FTM output with a oscilloscope to see the PWM.
