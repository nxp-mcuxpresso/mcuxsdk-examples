      brief: The FTM project is a demonstration program of the SDK FTM driver's dual-edge
        capture feature.This feature is available only on certain SoC's.The example
        sets up a FTM channel-pair for dual-edge capture. Once the input signal is
        received,this example will print the capture values and period of the input
        signal on the terminal window.
