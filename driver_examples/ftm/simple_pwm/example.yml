      brief: The FTM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK FTM driver.
        It sets up the FTMhardware block to output a center-aligned PWM signal. The
        PWM dutycycle is periodically updated.On boards that have an LED connected
        to the FTM pins, the user will see a change in LED brightness.
