# ftm_simple_pwm

## Overview
The FTM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK FTM driver. It sets up the FTM
hardware block to output a center-aligned PWM signal. The PWM dutycycle is periodically updated.
On boards that have an LED connected to the FTM pins, the user will see a change in LED brightness.

## Note
If the FTM instance has only TPM features, please use the TPM driver.
Can be judged by FSL_FEATURE_FTM_IS_TPM_ONLY_INSTANCE(base) macro.
