      brief: The ACOMP Interrupt Example shows how to use interrupt with ACOMP driver.In
        this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal
        (can be controlled by user) as the ACOMP's negative channel input. On the
        postive side, the internal voltage ladder is used to generate the fixed voltage
        abouthalf value of reference voltage.When running the project, change the
        input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would
        changebetween logic one and zero when the user-defined channel's voltage crosses
        the internal ladder's output. The change ofcomparator's output would generate
        the falling and rising edge events with their interrupts enabled. When any
        ACOMP interrupt happens, the ACOMP's ISR would turn on/off the LED light.
