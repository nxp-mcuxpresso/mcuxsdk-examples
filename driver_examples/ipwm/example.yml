      brief: The PWM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK PWM driver.
        It sets up the PWM hardwareblock to output PWM signals on one PWM channel.
        The example also shows PWM duty cycle is increase or decrease.The FIFO empty
        interrupt is provided. A new value will be loaded into FIFO when FIFO empty
        status bit is set. The PWM will run at the last set duty-cycle setting if
        all the values of the FIFO has been utilized, until the FIFO is reloaded or
        the PWM is disabled. When a new value is written, the duty cycle changes after
        the current period is over.The outputs can be observed by oscilloscope.
