      brief: 'The enet_txrx_multiring_transfer example shows the way to use ENET driver
        to   receive and transmit avb frame in the avb feature supported multi-ring
        platforms. this example is only supported in multi-ring platform.1. This example
        shows how to initialize the ENET MAC.2. How to use ENET MAC to transmit frames
        in avb supported multiple-ring platforms.The example transmits 30 number frames.
        For simple demo, we create frames with some special definition.1. Build transmission
        frames with broadcast mac address.2. Build different frames for each ring:
        10 normal ethernet frame, 10 similar IEC 61883-6 type frames,10 similar IEC
        61883-8 type frames and the two IEC 1722 avb frames are set with different
        vlan priority. Notice, To simply show how to use three different rings in
        rx/tx on one board. This example set PHY local loop and you will see there
        will be PHY init auto-negotiation fail and this is normal. because phy can
        not finishauto-negotiation when phy is in loop back mode. However, the auto-negotiation
        fail has no impact on this loop back example, so just forget about the failure
        auto-negotiation.'
