      brief: The enet_rxtx example shows the simplest way to use ENET driver for simple
        frame receive and transmit.1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET
        MAC.2. How to use ENET MAC to receive and transmit frame.The example transmits
        20 number broadcast frame, print the frame length, source MAC addressand destination
        MAC address when receive frame.Note, The RMII mode is used for default setting
        to initialize the ENET interface between MAC and the external PHY. youcan
        change it to MII mode as you wish. Please make sure the MII Mode setting in
        the MAC is synchronize to the settingin TWR-SERIAL board for the external
        PHY.
