      brief: The enet_rxtx_ptp1588 example shows the way to use ENET driver to   receive
        and transmit frame in the 1588 feature required cases.1. This example shows
        how to initialize the ENET MAC.2. How to use ENET MAC to receive and transmit
        frame.3. How to add to the multicast group to receive PTP 1588 message.4.
        How to get the time stamp of the PTP 1588 timer.4. How to use Get the ENET
        transmit and receive frame time stamp.The example transmits 20 number PTP
        event frame, shows the timestamp of the transmitted frame.The length, source
        MAC address and destination MAC address of the received frame will be print.
        The time stamp of the received timestamp will be print when the PTP message
        frame is received. Note, The RMII mode is used for default setting to initialize
        the ENET interface between MAC and the external PHY. you can change it to
        MII mode as you wish. Please make sure the MII Mode setting in the MAC is
        synchronize to the settingin TWR-SERIAL board for the external PHY.
