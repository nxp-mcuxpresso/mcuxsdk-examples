      brief: The qtmr_timer project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK QTMR
        driver to use QTMR as a timer.The quad-timer module provides four timer channels
        with a variety of controls affecting both individualand multi-channel features.
        It sets up the QTMR hardware block to trigger an interrupt every 50 millisecond.When
        chaining the first channel and the second channel, Timer interrupt occur every
        10 second.When the QTMR interrupt is triggered a message a printed on the
        UART terminal.
