      brief: 'The spi_interrupt_transfer_slave example shows how to use spi driver
        as slave to receive data from master.In this example, one spi instance as
        slave and another spi instance on other board as master. Master sends a piece
        of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks
        if the data received from master is correct. This example should work with
        spi_interrupt_transfer_master example. And this example should start first. '
