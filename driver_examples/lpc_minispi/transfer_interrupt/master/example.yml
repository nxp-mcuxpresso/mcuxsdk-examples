      brief: 'The spi_interrupt_transfer_master example shows how to use spi driver
        as master to do board to boardtransfer in interrupt way:In this example, one
        spi instance as master and another spi instance on othere board as slave.
        Mastersends a piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave.
        This example checks if the data received from slave is correct. This example
        need to work with spi_interrupt_transfer_slave example. '
