      brief: This driver example demonstrates how to setup PRINCE driver for the on-the-fly
        encryption/decryption of data stored in the internal flash memory. It shows
        how to enable encryption/decryption for specified flash memory address range,
        how to generate new IV code and how to load the IV code into the PRINCE bus
        encryption engine. The example also shows how to correctly perform PRINCE
        region erase and write operations with dummy data.
