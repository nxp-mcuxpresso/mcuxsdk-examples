      brief: 'The ADC12 continuous EDMA demo application demonstrates the usage of
        the ADC and EDMA peripheral while in a continuous mode. TheADC12 is first
        set to continuous mode. In continuous convert configuration, only the initial
        rising-edge to launch continuous conversions isobserved, and until conversion
        is aborted, the ADC12 continues to do conversions on the same SCn register
        that initiated the conversion. EDMA request will be asserted during an ADC12
        conversion complete event noted when any of the SC1n[COCO] flags is asserted.
        EDMA will transferADC12 results to memory and if users press any key, demo
        will average ADC12 results stored in memory and print average on the terminal.  '
