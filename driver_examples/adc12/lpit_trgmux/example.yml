      brief: The adc12_lpit_trgmux example shows how to use the LPIT and TRGMUX to
        generate a ADC trigger.In this example, user should indicate a channel to
        provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the ADC12'ssample
        input. When run the example, the ADC is triggered by TRGMUX and gets the ADC
        conversion result in the ADCConversion Complete (COCO) Interrupt. The LPIT
        is configured as periodic counter which will output pre-trigger andtigger
        signal to TRGMUX periodically.
