# tmu_monitor_report

## Overview
The TMU example shows how to configure TMU register to monitor and report the temperature from one or
more remote temperature measurement sites located on the chip.

TMU has access to multiple temperature measurement sites strategically located on the
chip. It monitors these sites and can signal an alarm if a programmed threshold is ever
exceeded.

Note: Before monitoring the temperature, we must programming the calibration table.
