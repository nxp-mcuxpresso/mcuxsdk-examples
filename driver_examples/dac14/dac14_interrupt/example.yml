      brief: The DAC14 interrupt example shows how to use the DAC FIFO interrupt.
        When the application starts to run, it will immediately enter the DAC ISR
        and write data into the FIFO which is empty at first. Once the DAC FIFO is
        triggered in the while loop, the data in it shall be read out; then the FIFO
        becomes empty again, and get another round of feed in the DAC ISR.
