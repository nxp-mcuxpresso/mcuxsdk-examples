      brief: The queued_spi_dma_b2b_transfer examples show how to use queued_spi driver
        in dma way. In this example, we need two boards, one board is used as queued_spi
        master and another board is used as queued_spi slave. The file 'queued_spi_dma_b2b_transfer_master.c'
        includes the queued_spi master code. This example uses the transactional API
        in queued_spi driver. queued_spi master sends/receives data to/from queued_spi
        slave in dma. (queued_spi slave uses dma to receive/send the data)
