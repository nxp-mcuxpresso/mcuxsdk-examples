      brief: The queued_spi_polling_b2b_transfer examples show how to use queued_spi
        driver in polling way. In this example we need two boards, one board is used
        as queued_spi master and another board is used as queued_spi slave. The file
        'queued_spi_polling_b2b_transfer_slave.c' includes the queued_spi slave code.
        queued_spi master sends/receives data to/from queued_spi slave in polling.
        (queued_spi slave uses interrupt to receive/send the data)
