      brief: The queued_spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer examples show how to use queued_spi
        driver in interrupt way. In this example, we need two boards, one board is
        used as queued_spi master and another board is used as queued_spi slave. The
        file 'queued_spi_interrupt_b2b_transfer_slave.c' includes the queued_spi slave
        code. This example uses the transactional API in queued_spi driver. queued_spi
        master sends/receives data to/from queued_spi slave in interrupt. (queued_spi
        slave uses interrupt to receive/send the data)
