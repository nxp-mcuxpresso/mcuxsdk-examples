      brief: The SD JPEG decoder example decodes a series of JPEG pictures stored
        on SD card then shows them one by one on panel. Two slots are used and each
        has one descriptor linked to itself. After slot 0 finishes slot 1 will be
        switch on in this round. After slot 1 finishes then the next round starts,
        slot 0 will be switched on again.
