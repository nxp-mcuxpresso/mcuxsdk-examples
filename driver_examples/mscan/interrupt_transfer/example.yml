      brief: The mscan_interrupt_transfer example shows how to use MSCAN driver in
        none-blocking interrupt way. In this example, 2 boards are connected through
        CAN bus. Endpoint A(board A) send a CAN Message to Endpoint B(board B) when
        user press space key in terminal. Endpoint B receive the message, print the
        message content to terminal and echo back the message. Endpoint A will increase
        the received message and waiting for the next transmission of the user initiated.
