# igpio_input_eqdc_signal

## Overview
The GPIO Example project is a program functioning as an encoder which outputs two quadrature signals and one interrupt signal.

The example is supported by the set, clear registers, and toggle write-only registers for each port output data register. 

## Running the demo
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
If you turn on the SW8 , and "SW8 is turned on, INDEX generated" is shown on the terminal window
