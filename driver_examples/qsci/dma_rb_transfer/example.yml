      brief: The qsci_dma_rb_transfer example demonstrates the usage of the KSDK QSCI
        DMA driver. In this example, a ring buffer is used with DMA enabled, data
        received will be stored in ring buffer first, while IDLE line is detected,
        the received characters will be read out, and echo them back to the terminal
        using DMA method.
